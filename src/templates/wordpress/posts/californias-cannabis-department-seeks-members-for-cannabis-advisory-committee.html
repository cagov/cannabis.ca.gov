<p><strong><em>Committee members will advise Department of Cannabis Control on cannabis regulations and public policy</em></strong></p>

<p>CALIFORNIA – California’s Department of Cannabis Control (DCC) today announced it will open applications for all seats on the Cannabis Advisory Committee (CAC). DCC is seeking applicants that reflect the diversity of California&nbsp;and the&nbsp;communities impacted by commercial cannabis activity.</p>

<p>Applicants must submit a completed <a href="https://cannabis.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads2021/12/DCC-1102_CAC-Application.pdf">CAC application form</a> and resume to <a href="mailto:CAC@cannabis.ca.gov">CAC@cannabis.ca.gov</a> by January 14, 2022, at 5 p.m. Incomplete applications will not be considered.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>“DCC will continue to engage with and through the Cannabis Advisory Committee to have a robust public discussion that supports the development of a regulatory framework that benefits all Californians and results in a safe, sustainable and equitable cannabis market,” said DCC Director Nicole Elliott.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>The CAC advises on the&nbsp;development of&nbsp;standards and regulations&nbsp;for commercial cannabis businesses, within the authority provided to DCC through Business and Professions Code, Division 10. This includes regulations necessary to protect public health and safety&nbsp;while ensuring a regulated environment for commercial cannabis activity that does not impose barriers that would perpetuate, rather than reduce and eliminate, the illicit cannabis market.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This will be the first time DCC makes appointments to this body and the first time since its establishment in 2017 that every seat will be open for consideration. Members of the CAC will be appointed by the Director of the Department of Cannabis Control.</p>

<p>The role of the committee and key representatives included in its composition are established through Business and Professions Code <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=BPC&amp;sectionNum=26014.&amp;highlight=true&amp;keyword=advisory%20committee">section 26014</a>.</p>
