<p>SACRAMENTO – California’s Department of Cannabis Control (DCC) has ordered a mandatory recall after identifying a batch of packaged cannabis flower contaminated with <em>Aspergillus niger</em>. Consumers who purchased Claybourne Co. flower are urged to check their packaging for the UID and batch numbers listed below and dispose of the flower if affected. To date, no illnesses have been reported. DCC is currently investigating the cause of the contamination.</p>

<p>The recall affects one batch of packaged cannabis flower, sold in various size jars between November 2, 2021 and January 26, 2022:&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>Brand name: Claybourne Co.&nbsp;</li><li>Strain: Head Banger</li><li>Track-and-trace UID number: 1A406030000326B000094476&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Batch number: 28090621HB</li></ul>

<p>Photos of the product packaging are included below. No other brands or Claybourne Co. batches are implicated by this recall.&nbsp;</p>

<p>DCC encourages consumers who purchased Claybourne Co. Head Banger flower during the affected timeframe to check their packaging for the UID and batch numbers listed above. If it matches, consumers should either dispose of the flower or return it to the cannabis retailer where it was purchased.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Aspergillus niger</em>, a fungus commonly known as black mold, is a contributor to post-harvest decay of fresh fruit, nuts, cereals and oilseeds. According to the CDC, most people breathe in Aspergillus spores every day without getting sick; however, people with weakened immune systems or lung diseases are at a higher risk of developing health problems due to Aspergillus.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The contamination was discovered as a result of information sharing between a third-party and DCC. Samples from multiple retailers were independently tested through DCC’s Cannabis Testing Laboratory and were confirmed to contain Aspergillus. DCC is currently investigating the cause of the contamination.&nbsp;</p>

<p>DCC has notified all cannabis retailers and distributors with affected product in their inventory. The licensees are required to immediately quarantine the product and are prohibited from selling it. DCC has provided guidance and will work closely with licensees to respond to the recall, including informing customers.</p>
