<p>SACRAMENTO – The Bureau of Cannabis Control (Bureau) today announced it has revoked a temporary testing laboratory license previously issued to PharmLabs, LLC operating in San Diego. The laboratory failed to meet the testing standards and procedures required by the Medicinal and Adult-Use Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act (MAUCRSA) and the Bureau’s regulations.</p>
<p>“The Bureau actively works with licensees to assist them in coming into compliance with state law; however, public safety is our highest priority”, Bureau of Cannabis Control Chief Lori Ajax said. “Although we have revoked PharmLabs, LLC’s temporary license, they are not precluded from applying for an annual license and demonstrating that they can operate in compliance with state rules in the future.”</p>
<p>Temporary licenses are conditional licenses that authorize the licensee to engage in commercial cannabis activity that would be permitted pursuant to an annual license of the same type. All temporary licensees are required to follow the same rules and regulations as annual licensees.</p>
<p>A temporary license issued by the Bureau is valid for 120 days and may be extended, at the Bureau’s discretion, for additional 90-day periods if a complete application for an annual license has been submitted.</p>
