<p>The Department of Cannabis Control (DCC) is providing notice to the public of its intent to readopt its emergency regulations that consolidate the commercial cannabis regulations. <strong>This readoption would allow emergency regulations to remain in place while DCC completes the regular rulemaking process, which began on Friday, March 4.</strong><br> <br>View the proposed finding of emergency and notice of proposed readoption  and the proposed text of emergency regulations below:</p>

<p>DCC will file the emergency readopt package with the Office of Administrative Law (OAL) after the required five-working day notice to the public.
