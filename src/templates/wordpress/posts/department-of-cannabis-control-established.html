<p>The Department of Cannabis Control (DCC) was established yesterday, following the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2021/07/12/california-roars-back-governor-newsom-signs-100-billion-california-comeback-plan-to-accelerate-states-recovery-and-tackle-persistent-challenges/" target="_blank">signing</a>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220AB141" target="_blank">Assembly Bill (AB) 141</a>. DCC consolidates the three state cannabis programs – the Bureau of Cannabis Control, CDFA’s CalCannabis Cultivation Licensing Division, and CDPH’s Manufactured Cannabis Safety Branch – into a single, new state department. Governor Newsom has&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2021/07/13/governor-newsom-announces-appointments-7-13-21/" target="_blank">appointed</a>&nbsp;Nicole Elliott to lead DCC as its first Director.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While a global pandemic delayed the implementation of DCC, the approval of AB 141 reflects a persistent commitment to move toward a unified approach to regulating cannabis in California.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now that we have created a single point-of-contact, we begin the process of streamlining licensing and regulations so we can better serve Californians. We will create as much continuity and consistency as possible as we transition into DCC. Our teams will continue to serve and work with you in the same ways. We will also continue to use the current licensing systems.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The timeline below shows what has happened so far this year:&nbsp;</p>
