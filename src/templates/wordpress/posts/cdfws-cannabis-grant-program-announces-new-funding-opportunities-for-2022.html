<p>The California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) today announced two upcoming funding opportunities through the Cannabis Restoration Grant Program (CRGP). Each solicitation will offer up to $10 million for qualified projects.</p>

<p>The first opportunity is the draft Public Lands Cleanup and Remediation Solicitation for the cleanup and remediation of illicit cannabis cultivation impacts on qualified public land. The second opportunity is the draft Watershed Enhancement Solicitation for enhancing watershed and communities through road improvements, cleanup and remediation on private lands, wildlife and habitat enhancements, and/or water conservation projects.</p>

<p>“We are excited to continue to engage with organizations of all sizes to learn about projects that benefit the environment,” said Jeremy Valverde, CDFW’s Cannabis Program Director. “Working together with entities that may apply for these funds, we can make huge strides in protecting our native plants, fish and wildlife, which is a benefit to all in our great state.”</p>

<p>Grants through the CRGP are funded through California’s Environmental Restoration and Protection Account pursuant to Revenue and Taxation Code section 34019(f)(2), and may be used to fund the cleanup, remediation, and restoration of environmental damage in watersheds affected by cannabis cultivation and related activities, and to support local partnerships for this purpose.</p>
