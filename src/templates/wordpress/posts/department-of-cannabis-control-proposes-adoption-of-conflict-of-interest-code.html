<p>The Department of Cannabis Control (DCC) is providing notice of its intention to adopt its proposed Conflict of Interest Code as required by the Political Reform Act.</p>

<h2><strong>Notice of Intention to Adopt Conflict of Interest Code</strong></h2>

<p>DCC is providing notice to the public of its intention to adopt the proposed Conflict of Interest Code. The proposed code designates:</p>

<ul><li>Employee positions that must file a Form 700 Statement of Economic Interests and</li><li>The financial interests that those employees must disclose</li></ul>

<p>The Political Reform Act prohibits public officials and employees from using their official positions to influence governmental decisions in which they have financial interests. A Conflict of Interest Code is intended to identify public officials and employees whose positions lead them to participate in governmental decision-making, and to require them to disclose relevant financial interests. This process helps to identify and disclose potential conflicts of interest. More information about the Political Reform Act, including the nature and role of a Conflict of Interest Code, is available on the <a href="https://www.fppc.ca.gov/the-law/the-political-reform-act.html">Fair Political Practices Commission’s website</a>.</p>
