<p><strong>Emergency rulemaking action would create a single set of regulations for commercial cannabis activity in California</strong></p>

<p><strong>SACRAMENTO, CA</strong> –  The Department of Cannabis Control (DCC) today published proposed emergency regulations. This action follows those taken in July by DCC to move all cannabis regulations into Title 4 of the California Code of Regulations. This is the second and most significant action taken by DCC thus far to improve the cannabis regulatory framework and comes within the first 60 days as a new state department.</p>

<p>The proposed regulations consolidate, clarify and make consistent requirements, including aligning license application requirements, ownership and financial interest of a cannabis business, and establishing uniform terminology and definitions across license types. The emergency regulations also include rules governing trade samples between businesses, which was recently authorized by <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220AB141">Assembly Bill (AB) 141</a>.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“Today’s action reflects the Governor’s commitment and our ongoing effort to streamline requirements for California cannabis businesses and simplify participation in the legal, regulated market,” said Nicole Elliott, DCC Director. “Many of the proposed changes are the direct result of feedback received during consolidation.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The regulations were previously adopted by the three former state cannabis programs: the Bureau of Cannabis Control (Department of Consumer Affairs), CalCannabis Cultivation Licensing Division (Department of Food and Agriculture), and the Manufactured Cannabis Safety Branch (Department of Public Health). Prior to consolidation, these three programs regulated different aspects of the supply chain and each adopted regulations corresponding to their areas of authority.</p>

<p>The consolidation of the three previous state cannabis programs into a standalone state department was proposed by Governor Newsom through his state budget. On July 12, 2021, DCC was formally established following the passage of AB 141. <a>&nbsp;</a></p>

<p>If approved, the proposed regulations would become effective at the end of September.</p>
