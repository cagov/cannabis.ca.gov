<p>The Department of Cannabis Control’s (DCC) consolidated emergency regulations are approved and now in effect. The regulations create consistent standards for cannabis licensees across all license types, by aligning application requirements, unifying terminology, and clarifying ownership and financial interest requirements. The regulations also establish rules for trade samples between businesses.</p>

<p>A prominent element of the regulations establishes rules allowing for trade samples between businesses, which was recently authorized by <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220AB141">Assembly Bill (AB) 141</a>. These rules include the type of licensees that can give and receive samples, packaging, tracking and sample sizes. Prior to AB 141, business to business trade samples were allowed only if the product did not contain cannabis.</p>

<p>This is DCC’s second regulatory action to consolidate, clarify and make consistent the regulations within its first two months as a new state department. </p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“That these changes came so soon after being established as a state department reflects the Department’s level of commitment to improve the regulatory environment for our current and prospective licensees,” said Elliott.</p></blockquote>

<p>The Office of Administrative Law approved the emergency regulations and filed them with the Secretary of State on September 27, 2021.</p>
