<p>SACRAMENTO – The Bureau of Cannabis Control (Bureau) announced today that it has submitted <a href="https://bcc.ca.gov/law_regs/cannabis_regs.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">proposed emergency cannabis regulations</a> to the Office of Administrative Law (OAL). These proposed regulations would make it mandatory for cannabis businesses to post their unique Quick Response Code (QR Code) certificate in storefront windows and carry it with them while transporting or delivering cannabis.</p>
<p>The emergency regulations are designed to help consumers identify licensed cannabis retail stores, assist law enforcement and support the legal cannabis market, where products such as vape cartridges are routinely tested to protect public health and safety.</p>
<p>Those who wish to comment on the proposed emergency regulations must submit their comment directly to OAL within five calendar days of OAL’s posting of the proposed regulations on their website. The comment period will begin on Monday, February 3, 2020, and end on Saturday, February 8, 2020. You may submit comments on the proposed regulations to OAL at:</p>
<p><strong>Office of Administrative Law</strong><br />OAL Reference Attorney <br />300 Capitol Mall, Suite 1250 <br />Sacramento, CA 95814 <br />E-mail: <a href="mailto:staff@oal.ca.gov">staff@oal.ca.gov</a></p>
