<p>California became the first state to allow medicinal cannabis use when voters passed the Compassionate Use Act in 1996. Today, cannabis is legal in California for both medicinal and adult (recreational) use.</p>

<p>The cannabis industry is strictly regulated to make sure:</p>

<ul><li>Businesses operate safely</li><li>Products are contaminant-free and labeled to inform purchasers</li><li>Cannabis is kept away from children</li></ul>

<p>Statutes, regulations and ordinances are all types of laws that work together to set rules for businesses and consumers.</p>

<h2>What are statutes, regulations and ordinances?</h2>

<ul><li><strong>Statutes</strong> are laws written and passed by the state legislature, and signed into law by the Governor. They apply to the whole state and create basic rules that apply to everyone in the state.</li><li><strong>Regulations</strong> are rules created by a state agency that interpret the statute and make it more specific. Like statutes, regulations also apply to the whole state. The Department of Cannabis Control (DCC) creates regulations that apply to cannabis businesses.</li><li><strong>Ordinances</strong> are rules created by cities and counties to set even more specific rules for the local community. They set the time, place and manner a business can operate or a resident can take certain actions. An ordinance only applies in the city or county that created it. Ordinances can be more specific than statutes or regulations, but they cannot work against them. Check with your city and county to find out if they have passed any ordinances for cannabis.</li></ul>

<h3>Statutes</h3>

<p>The main statute for cannabis businesses&nbsp;is in the Business and Professions Code. It is called the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayexpandedbranch.xhtml?tocCode=BPC&amp;division=10.&amp;title=&amp;part=&amp;chapter=&amp;article=" target="_blank">Medicinal and Adult Use Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act</a> (MAUCRSA). MAUCRSA sets up a basic framework for licensing, oversight and enforcement related to cannabis businesses.</p>

<p>In addition to cannabis-specific laws, cannabis businesses also have to follow the same rules that other businesses in California must follow. For example, there are rules in the statutes about waste disposal, protecting the environment, vehicle registration and paying taxes.</p>

<p>There are also statutes that set rules for people using cannabis in California. The <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?lawCode=HSC&amp;division=10.&amp;title=&amp;part=&amp;chapter=6.&amp;article=2." target="_blank">Health and Safety Code</a> has a section on cannabis with:</p>

<ul><li>Rules to prevent people under age 21 from getting cannabis</li><li>Limits on how much cannabis a person can carry at a time</li><li>Requirements for medical cannabis</li></ul>
