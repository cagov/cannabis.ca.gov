<h3><strong>About the Liveade Wellness</strong></h3>

<p>Betty Mitchell is the owner of Liveade Wellness, a specialty indoor cannabis small business in the City of Sacramento. Mitchell grows about 1,000 square feet canopy of cannabis at the 1,700 square-foot facility, as well as manufactures a multi-use food powder using a moringa blend. Over time, Mitchell plans to expand the facility to about 10,000 square feet. Mitchell is also in the process of obtaining a distributor license since the quantity of her product is still fairly small, which presents a challenge matching up with the right distributor.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Commitment to Helping Others Navigate the Legal Market</strong></h3>

<p>Now that she has been through the licensing process, Mitchell said she’d like to give back to aspiring cannabis operators who might benefit from her advice.</p>

<p>“I had opened businesses before, so I know the challenges that are involved. But many people in the industry have romanticized the work,” Mitchell observes. “Most of these growers have never written a business plan in their lives and working with so many different agencies can be intimidating.”&nbsp;<br><br>Mitchell has created a check-list for anyone in the industry who comes to her for advice as they consider pursuing their license – outlining the financial commitments they should be prepared for and lessons she has learned through her own experience.</p>

<p>“At the beginning of this process, everyone had to figure it out – including the different entities you have to work with, but they have really stepped up their game,” Mitchell shares. “I wouldn’t have gotten this far without the help of the City], the Sacramento Building Department and the Cannabis Opportunity, Reinvestment and Equity Program (CORE) at the Greater Sacramento Urban League.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Proud to Be a Licensed Grower and Carry On a Legacy</strong></h3>

<p>Mitchell ultimately wanted to work in the cannabis industry because she has seen the powerful benefits that cannabis can have for individuals who are recovering from an injury, or are otherwise in pain.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When Mitchell was a teenager growing up in Arkansas, her uncle grew cannabis and created a powder that Mitchell would help him to distribute to locals, particularly migrants and other impoverished communities, as medicine.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“While I don’t personally use cannabis, I always thought that if it became legal, I wanted to recreate that powder,” shares Mitchell. “That’s the legacy I want. I want to recreate that powder to help take the pain away and continue what my uncle started.”&nbsp;</p>
