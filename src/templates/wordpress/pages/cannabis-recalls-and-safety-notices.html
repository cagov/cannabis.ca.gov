<p>Recalls are used to remove defective or&nbsp;potentially&nbsp;unsafe&nbsp;products from the market.&nbsp;There are two types of recalls:&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>Voluntary recalls</li><li>Mandatory recalls</li></ul>

<p>Voluntary recalls are conducted by the cannabis business. Mandatory recalls are ordered by the Department of Cannabis Control (DCC). </p>

<h2><strong>Mandatory recalls</strong>&nbsp;</h2>

<p>DCC can order a mandatory recall when:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>There is an immediate and serious threat to human life or health, and&nbsp;</li><li>Other remedies would cause an unreasonable delay&nbsp;</li></ul>

<p>During&nbsp;a mandatory recall, DCC notifies all licensees who have the affected product. We provide guidance about what to do, and we work closely with licensees to take needed action.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
