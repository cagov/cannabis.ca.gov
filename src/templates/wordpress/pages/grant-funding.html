<p>California offers cannabis-related grants to local governments to fund programs and universities to fund research.</p>

<h2>Funding for local jurisdictions</h2>

<h3>Local Jurisdiction Assistance Grant Program</h3>

<p>California is committed to quickly transition cannabis businesses from provisional to annual licenses. One-time grant funding, totaling $100 million, is available to help eligible jurisdictions participate in this effort. Extra funds are available for eligible local jurisdictions with social equity programs. The funds seek to target areas with the highest numbers of provisional licensed businesses. Large numbers of small, legacy and equity businesses operate within these areas.</p>

<p><strong>Eligibility: </strong>17 cities and counties with the highest numbers of provisional licenses</p>

<p><strong>Status: </strong>DCC awarded grant funding in January 2022.  </p>
