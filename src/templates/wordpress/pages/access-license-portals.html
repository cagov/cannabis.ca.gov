		<summary>Why are there three licensing systems?</summary>
		<div class="accordion-body">

<p>The Department of Cannabis Control was created in July 2021 by merging three existing state programs. Each of those former programs had its own online licensing system.</p>

<p>We anticipate creating one licensing system for all businesses, but it will take time to do that. Until then, use the system for the license type you have or are applying for.</p>
