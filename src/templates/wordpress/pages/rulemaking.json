OAL makes sure that state agencies follow California’s laws when they adopt new regulations.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There are two types of rulemaking procedures: regular and emergency.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Most regulations are adopted using the regular rulemaking process. Some are adopted using the emergency rulemaking process, which allows rules to go into effect faster. The Department of Cannabis Control (DCC) can use the emergency rulemaking process when making rules for cannabis businesses.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Regular rulemaking process</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true} -->\n<ol><li>An agency publishes a summary of the proposed regulations in the California Regulatory Notice Register (also called Notice Register).
