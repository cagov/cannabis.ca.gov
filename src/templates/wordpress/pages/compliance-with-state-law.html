<p>A vibrant legal cannabis market is better for all Californians. The Department of Cannabis Control (DCC) supports integrity in the cannabis market through:</p>

<ul><li>Routine inspections</li><li>Investigations</li></ul>

<p>DCC works with licensees to resolve compliance challenges. Routine inspections are an opportunity to assess licensee compliance with state law.</p>

<p>When violations are found, DCC staff will show you the issue and instruct you to fix it. They may also issue a Notice to Comply, which identifies violations and gives a deadline for correcting them.</p>

<h2>How state law is enforced</h2>

<ul><li>Citations that may include:&nbsp;<ul><li>Fines – up to $5,000 per violation (licensees) or $30,000 per violation (unlicensed persons)</li></ul><ul><li>Order of abatement</li></ul></li><li>Embargo – prevents cannabis and cannabis product from being moved</li><li>License suspension</li><li>License revocation</li><li>Fines based on disciplinary guidelines</li></ul>
