<p>Businesses use financial services to pay for expenses, save money or manage risk. Because cannabis is illegal under federal law, it can be hard for cannabis businesses to get access to financial services such as:</p>

<ul><li>Checking accounts</li><li>Savings accounts</li><li>Credit cards</li><li>Insurance</li><li>Loans</li><li>Investments</li></ul>

<h2>Access to banking and loans</h2>

<p>Federal law requires financial institutions to monitor and report certain information about cannabis businesses. If your financial institution needs information about you to provide services, you can authorize the Department of Cannabis Control (DCC) to share information. This may make it easier to get access to financial services for your business.</p>

<p>This program is optional. We will only share information with your permission.</p>

<h3>Information you can share</h3>

<p>You can authorize DCC to share any of the following information with your financial institutions.</p>

<h4>Application information</h4>

<p>This lets DCC share your license or renewal application. DCC does not share criminal background information or the personal information of owners.</p>

<h4>Compliance and enforcement information</h4>

<p>This lets DCC share any documents issued to you in a disciplinary proceeding including:</p>

<ul><li>Citation</li><li>Notice of embargo</li><li>Notice of suspension or revocation</li></ul>

<h4>Track and Trace information</h4>

<p>This lets DCC share data you enter into the Track and Trace system. DCC does not share information about employees or information about other licensed businesses you work with. Data we share includes:</p>

<ul><li>On-hand inventory</li><li>Transfers of cannabis and cannabis products into and out of your premises</li><li>Sales (for retailers)</li></ul>

<h3>How to authorize release of information</h3>

<h2>Insurance</h2>

<p>Insurance protects businesses against certain types of risks, such as:</p>

<ul><li>Property damage</li><li>Liability</li><li>Worker injury</li><li>Natural disasters</li></ul>

<p>When buying insurance, ask your agent or broker if your business would be covered in the event of a cannabis-related loss. Some policies have cannabis or public policy exclusions in them.</p>
