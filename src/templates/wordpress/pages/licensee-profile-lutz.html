<h2><strong>Barron Lutz</strong></h2>

<p><strong>Nasha Humboldt&nbsp;</strong><br><strong>Arcata, Humboldt County&nbsp;</strong></p>

<h3><strong>About Nasha Humboldt&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Barron Lutz owns and operates Nasha Humboldt, a cannabis hash producer in the beautiful mountain county of Humboldt in Northern California. Nasha partners traditional techniques and state-of-the-art machinery to produce a high potency, terpene-rich hash that is free of chemicals.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lutz says Nasha represents old-school hash, made in a natural way, delivering high-quality concentrate to customers. Nasha also ensures quality by developing relationships with experienced and reputable local growers. With these relationships, Lutz says Nasha can curate every aspect of their hash which translates to the purest, most potent hash.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lutz spent his formative years living in India, which is where he developed his appreciation for hash, studying the origins of Hashish and the culture surrounding it. This influence is seen throughout the Nasha brand and the production of their hash products. This is a point of pride for Lutz, who reiterated, “India is what gave me my love for hash and now I am trying to replicate a similar style of pressed and rolled Hash in California.”</p>

<h3><strong>The Benefits of Being in the Legal Marketplace&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>For Lutz, one of the biggest benefits of being in the legal marketplace is education. In the legal marketplace, Lutz can share his passion for cannabis hash with large audience. When consumers visit Nasha’s website, they can learn about the products they purchase in the stain library or by looking up specifics about each pre-roll batch produced. Tracking down the strain or batch will tell you which farm the flower came from, when it was harvested, what flavors you can expect, and even the characteristics of the smoke when consumed. This is all part of Lutz’s mission to educate cannabis consumers about the products they are purchasing and why they should share in his appreciation and passion for producing high quality hash.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Pride in Being a Licensed Manufacturer&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Lutz spoke about receiving his license and what it meant to him saying, “Receiving my license was a moment of pride, relief, and excitement. I was one of the first licenses to be approved in Humboldt County and I knew I was on the forefront of the next chapter in cannabis. My license is important to me because it allows me to protect my hard work and leverage additional resources to scale my business.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nasha prides itself on sourcing only the finest flower to produce natural, solventless hash using skills practiced over many years. That is why Lutz is passionate about partnering with local farms and featuring information about them on the packaging of his product. “We were one of the first manufacturers to be licensed in the county and in fact one of the first Humboldt manufacturers to be licensed at the state level,” Lutz said. “We are proud of this because what we do is really important. We highlight the local farms we work with and act much like a wine maker who is working with local estates to produce a high-quality product.” Each of the partner farms are also featured on Nasha’s website where people can learn more about the hard-working growers central to Nasha’s business.</p>
