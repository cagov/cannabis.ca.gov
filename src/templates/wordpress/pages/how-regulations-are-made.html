<p>Regulations are changed through a process called rulemaking. The rulemaking process:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>Provides the public opportunity to take part in the process&nbsp;</li><li>Creates records that explain the reason for each rule&nbsp;</li></ul>

<p>There are two main types of rulemaking:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>Regular rulemaking – <strong>takes approximately 8-12 months</strong>&nbsp;</li><li>Emergency rulemaking – <strong>takes approximately 20-30 days</strong>&nbsp;</li></ul>

<p>DCC must follow the Administrative Procedures Act (APA) when adopting regulations. The Office of Administrative Law (OAL) reviews proposed changes; they make sure the APA is followed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Steps in the rulemaking process&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Before the rulemaking process, DCC:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>Identifies needed policy changes&nbsp;</li><li>Gathers research, information and materials&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Develops regulation text and supporting documents&nbsp;</li></ul>

<ul><li>Engages stakeholders&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>

<p>We also assess economic and fiscal impact of the proposed regulations.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>How you can participate in the rulemaking process&nbsp;</h2>

<p>The rulemaking process includes opportunities to share feedback. You can submit feedback during the public comment period:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>By email or mail&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>During a public hearing&nbsp;</li></ul>

<p>Find instructions for where to submit your comment on our Rulemaking page [insert link].&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Tips for submitting a comment</strong>&nbsp;</h3>

<ul><li><strong>Include the section number or topic</strong>. This helps us understand what you’re commenting on.&nbsp;</li></ul>

<ul><li><strong>Be specific</strong>. Tell us how the regulation affects or would affect you. Include data or examples, where relevant.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Comment only on what’s being proposed</strong>. DCC will only consider comments related to the proposed regulations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Phrase it as a statement</strong>. Instead of posing a question, phrase your comment as a statement. For example, instead of “What does this mean?” say “The wording of this section is confusing, so I don’t understand what it would require me to do.”&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Tell us what you like, too</strong>. Share which proposals you like, not just the ones you want to see changed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Share a suggestion, if you have one</strong>. Tell us what you would prefer and why you think it would be better. Sharing an alternative helps us consider how the regulation could be made better.&nbsp;</li></ul>

<ul><li><strong>You only need to submit once</strong>. Your comment is registered once, no matter how many times you send it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Don’t include confidential or private information</strong>. Comments become part of the public record. Don’t include information that you wouldn’t want shared with others.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Submit your comment by the deadline.</strong> Make sure your comment is submitted before the end of the designated comment period, so it can be considered.&nbsp;</li></ul>

<p>We’ve created a <a href="https://cannabis.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Rulemaking_Public-comment-template.docx">public comment template</a> to make it easy for you submit your feedback.</p>

<h3><strong>Public comment hearings</strong>&nbsp;</h3>

<p>You can record a verbal comment during a public comment hearing, if one is held or requested. Hearings are not an opportunity to ask questions or discuss the proposals. They are simply a forum for recording verbal comments.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you submitted your comment in writing, you do not need to submit it again through a hearing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h4><strong>How to provide comment during a hearing</strong>&nbsp;</h4>

<ol class="steps"><li><strong>Give your name and contact information</strong><br><span class="has-inline-color has-black-color">We ask for this so we can send you any revisions that are made.</span></li><li><strong>Tell us which section number or topic you&#8217;re commenting on</strong><br><span class="has-inline-color has-black-color"></span></li><li><strong>Give your comment</strong><span class="has-inline-color has-black-color">Follow the tips above for submitting a comment.</span></li></ol>

<h3><strong>What happens to public comments</strong>&nbsp;</h3>

<p>DCC reviews all comments received. We may make changes to the proposed regulations, as a result.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>We may make changes to the proposed regulations after reading the comments. If we make major or substantial changes, we publish revisions and hold another comment period. This lets you review the changes and comment again.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>During regular rulemakings, we respond to all comments received in a document called the Final Statement of Reasons. This is published at the end of the rulemaking process. It lists all comments received and includes information about why we did or did not make changes in response to that comment.&nbsp;</p>
