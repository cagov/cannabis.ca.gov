<h3>DCC Conflict of Interest Code </h3>

<p><strong>Type</strong>: Special rulemaking</p>

<p><strong>Status</strong>: Under review</p>

<p>California law requires all state and local government agencies to establish and follow a Conflict of Interest Code. These codes require agency officials who routinely participate in decisions to publicly disclose personal financial information. They designate: </p>

<ul><li>Which employee positions must file a Form 700 Statement of Economic Interests </li><li>The financial interests that those employees must disclose</li></ul>

<p>DCC is proposing to adopt a Conflict of Interest Code. </p>

<p>The Political Reform Act prohibits public officials and employees from using their official positions to influence governmental decisions in which they have financial interests. A Conflict of Interest Code helps identify and disclose potential conflicts of interest. Learn more about the Political Reform Act on the <a href="https://www.fppc.ca.gov/learn/rules-on-conflict-of-interest-codes.html#:~:text=Why%20Government%20Agencies%20Must%20Adopt%20a%20Conflict%20of%20Interest%20Code&amp;text=To%20help%20identify%20potential%20conflicts,Economic%20Interests%20(Form%20700).">Fair Political Practices Commission’s website</a>.</p>

<h2>Completed rulemaking actions</h2>

<h3><strong>Cannabis license fee waivers</strong></h3>

<p><strong>Type</strong>: Readoption of emergency regulations</p>

<p><strong>Status</strong>: Approved June 6, 2022</p>

<p>The Department of Cannabis Control (DCC) is providing notice to the public of its intent to readopt its emergency regulations implementing Senate Bill 166 which requires DCC to develop and implement a program to provide waivers for cannabis licensing fees, with at least 60 percent of the total amount of fee waivers allocated to fee waivers for local equity applicants and licenses, as required by law. The cannabis equity fee waiver program is designed to assist commercial cannabis license applicants and licensees who have been harmed by the War on Drugs. DCC proposes this readoption action to allow emergency regulations, with amendments, to remain in place while DCC continues working to begin the process of permanently adopting the regulations through the regular rulemaking action.</p>

<h3>Equity fee waivers</h3>

<p><strong>Type</strong>: Emergency rulemaking</p>

<p><strong>Status</strong>: Approved December 20, 2021</p>

<p>DCC adopted emergency regulations to provide licensing fee waivers to qualified equity businesses statewide. The waivers are designed to assist individuals harmed by the War on Drugs with starting and operating a cannabis business. The regulations implement the fee waiver provisions of <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001o5gXg2WtWHqT5qP2D0F-nSOXc_NXPFQIKULp13NsCQ1C_jHsdXZj_WgAS66TQs62H9ncwJ61Rxc0skFSH71hIblaF8H3sBeg9wONsLJOq_uXL2ahxhnKN7PQXrFYP3VsvisuPXye-lWLjPHgX9yoIwqkebwBeZ822CKoSoLpMWI-NcWjK91ZpLALJ4UXCDS1RIEjkH3QRB_fP8zXPRMly5H8Sz1gUFKmA9YVj9Y3qF0=&amp;c=2JFV7WHTI-jUDtrqhgYhFmoF6sfJsqV_kC9r2iJFzdZGPFQRVLmdeg==&amp;ch=DnKSFVMrGLPbVCUtCEvzsW4MyonQ_ApglixcGJx5JPoeqeyL-0atlA==__;!!AvL6XA!nAHoDsRO17wp6LlixZiJ6jfpQLnboIyv-G-0ll6icK6EvUDpLDcBBwjCU0-fC-vff__hbKWxjw$">Senate Bill 166</a>. </p>

<p>This statewide program provides financial support to cannabis business by waiving licensing fees if applicants and licensees meet the equity eligibility criteria, such as past cannabis convictions or arrests, reduced income or residence in an area disproportionately impacted by past criminal justice policies, as well as other criteria.</p>

<p>The emergency regulations add specificity to eligibility criteria established through SB 166 and establish a process for equity applicants and licensees to request waivers for licensing fees.</p>

<h3>Re-titling of cannabis regulations</h3>

<p><strong>Type</strong>: Section 100</p>

<p><strong>Status</strong>: Approved July 14, 2021</p>

<p>The three existing sets of regulations were moved into one title in the California Code of Regulations. The cannabis regulations are now together in Title 4, Division 19. Sections were also renumbered. No changes were made to the requirements in regulation.</p>

<p>This change used a rulemaking action called a Section 100. Section 100 lets agencies make changes to regulations that have no regulatory effect.</p>
