This order went into effect on Thursday, March 19, 2020, and is in place until further notice.<br>The order identifies certain services as essential, including food, prescriptions, and healthcare. These services can continue despite the stay at home order. Because cannabis is an essential medicine for many residents, licensees may continue to operate at this time so long as their operations comply with local rules and regulations.<br>Any licensee that continues to operate must adopt social distancing and anti-congregating measures and must follow the CDC&#8217;s <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html">Interim Guidance for Businesses and Employers to Plan and Respond to Coronavirus Disease</a> at all times.</p><p><em>To subscribe to email alerts to hear about updates as they become available, please visit the Bureau’s website at </em><a href="https://bcc.ca.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>https://bcc.ca.gov/</em></a><em>.
