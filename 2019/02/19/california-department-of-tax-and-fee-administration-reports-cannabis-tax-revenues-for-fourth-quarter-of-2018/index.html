Tax revenue reported by the cannabis industry totaled $103.3 million for 4th quarter returns due by January 31, 2019, which includes state cultivation, excise, and sales taxes. It does not include tax revenue collected by each jurisdiction.</p><p>As of February 14, 2019, California&#8217;s cannabis excise tax generated $50.8 million in revenue reported on 4th quarter returns due by January 31, 2019. The cultivation tax generated $16.4 million and the sales tax generated $36.1 million in reported revenue. Retail sales of medicinal cannabis and medicinal cannabis products are exempt from sales and use taxes if the purchaser provides a valid Medical Marijuana Identification card and valid government-issued identification card.</p><p>Previously reported revenue for 3rd quarter returns was revised to $100.8 million, which included $53.3 million in excise tax, $12.6 million in cultivation tax, and $34.9 million in sales tax.</p><p>Revisions to quarterly data are the result of amended and late returns, and other tax return adjustments.</p><p>In November 2016, California voters approved Proposition 64, the Control, Regulate, and Tax Adult Use of Marijuana Act. Beginning on January 1, 2018, two new cannabis taxes went into effect: a cultivation tax on all harvested cannabis that enters the commercial market and a 15 percent excise tax upon purchasers of cannabis and cannabis products.
