Enforcement staff also confiscated 9,885 illegal vape pens and $128,742 in cash.</p><p>“This week’s collaborative enforcement efforts were a huge success,” said Bureau Chief Lori Ajax. “We look forward to working with local jurisdictions and law enforcement as we continue to shut down unlicensed operators in the illicit cannabis market.”</p><p>All commercial cannabis activity in California must be conducted on a premises with a valid license issued by the appropriate state cannabis licensing authority.
