<p>Regulations are state laws with specific rules for how businesses&nbsp;and others must operate.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Department of Cannabis Control&#8217;s (DCC) regulations are in California Code of Regulations, title 4, division 19.</p>

<p>DCC is <a href="https://cannabis.ca.gov/about-us/consolidation/">taking steps to simplify</a> the cannabis regulations. &nbsp;</p>

<p>DCC has taken two regulatory actions to combine the previous cannabis regulations. View the <a href="https://cannabis.ca.gov/resources/rulemaking/#approved-rulemaking-actions">recently-approved changes</a> made to the regulations.</p>

<h2>Pending rulemaking actions</h2>

<h3>AB 1525 Certificate of Compliance</h3>

<p>DCC is proposing to adopt regulations to implement Assembly Bill 1525.  The regulations allow licensees to <a href="https://cannabis.ca.gov/resources/banking-insurance/" data-type="page" data-id="709">authorize us to share information</a> with financial institutions. </p>

<p>These regulations are currently active as emergency regulations. This action would adopt them more permanently through the regular rulemaking process. </p>

<h2>Completed rulemaking actions</h2>

<h3>Quick Response (QR) Code &#8211; Approved November 15, 2021</h3>

<p>QR code certificates help the public check if a cannabis business is licensed. This helps people distinguish licensed cannabis businesses from unlicensed ones. Retailers and distributors must display the certificate. Employees transporting or delivering cannabis goods must also carry the QR code certificate.</p>

<p>DCC submitted the final proposed rulemaking package to the Office of Administrative Law (OAL) on October 5, 2021. The submission included a <a href="https://cannabis.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/QR-Code-Cert-of-Compliance-FSOR-and-Updated-Digest-9.28.2021.pdf">final statement of reasons</a> with responses to public comments. The regulations were approved by OAL and filed OAL on November 15, 2021.</p>

<h3>Application process requirements &#8211; Decision not to proceed</h3>

<p>DCC will not proceed with the rulemaking to change application process requirements. The Bureau of Cannabis Control began this rulemaking in fall 2020.</p>

<p><a href="https://cannabis.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/Notice-of-Decision-Not-to-Proceed.pdf">Notice of decision not to proceed</a></p>

<p>The rulemaking appeared in the California Regulatory Notice Register on October 16, 2020. The OAL Notice file number is Z-2020-1006-06.</p>

<h3><strong>Emergency rulemaking for consolidation of the cannabis regulations</strong></h3>

<p>DCC conducted an emergency rulemaking action. This rulemaking combined the three sets of cannabis regulations into one. It consolidates, clarifies and makes consistent licensing and enforcement requirements for cannabis businesses.</p>

<h4><strong>Rulemaking timeline </strong></h4>

<p>DCC gave notice of the proposed adoption of the emergency regulations on September 8, 2021. DCC filed the emergency rules with the OAL on September 15, 2021. OAL approved the regulations on September 27, 2021. </p>

<h3>Information sharing with financial institutions</h3>

<p>The three cannabis programs adopted emergency regulations to implement Assembly Bill 1525 in February 2021. The regulations allow licensees to <a href="https://cannabis.ca.gov/resources/banking-insurance/" data-type="page" data-id="709">authorize us to share information</a> with financial institutions.</p>

<p>The emergency regulations were adopted in February 2021. </p>

<p>DCC began a rulemaking process to readopt the regulations on July 16, 2021. OAL approved the readoption of emergency regulations on August 2, 2021. They were filed with the Secretary of State and became effective on the same day.</p>

<h3>Section 100 to move cannabis regulations</h3>

<p>The three existing sets of regulations were moved into one title in the California Code of Regulations. The cannabis regulations are now together in Title 4, Division 19. Sections were also renumbered. No changes were made to the requirements in regulation.</p>

<p>This change used a rulemaking action called a Section 100. Section 100 lets agencies make changes to regulations that have no regulatory effect.</p>

<p>OAL approved the rulemaking actions and filed them with the Secretary of State on July 14, 2021.</p>

<h2>How regulations are made</h2>

<p>Regulations are made through a process called rulemaking. It gives the public the opportunity to take part in the creation of regulations proposed by California state agencies.</p>

<p>The Office of Administrative Law (OAL) oversees the rulemaking process. OAL makes sure that state agencies follow California’s laws when they adopt new regulations.</p>

<p>There are two types of rulemaking procedures: regular and emergency.</p>

<p>Most regulations are adopted using the regular rulemaking process. Some are adopted using the emergency rulemaking process, which allows rules to go into effect faster. The Department of Cannabis Control (DCC) can use the emergency rulemaking process when making rules for cannabis businesses.</p>

<h3>Regular rulemaking process</h3>

<ol><li>An agency publishes a summary of the proposed regulations in the California Regulatory Notice Register (also called Notice Register). The summary explains what the regulation does, why it is being created and its possible impact.</li><li>The public has 45 days to comment on the proposed regulations.</li><li>The agency publishes a summary of the public comments and the responses in the Notice Register.</li><li>If the agency changes the regulation based on the comments, the public has another 15 days to comment.</li><li>Once the agency is satisfied with the regulations, it publishes an updated summary to the Notice Register.</li><li>The agency has up to one year from the first notice to complete the regulations.</li></ol>

<h3>Emergency rulemaking process</h3>

<p>Emergency regulations are rules that can be put in place immediately while the agency completes the full rulemaking process. The emergency rulemaking process has different requirements, but generally includes:</p>

<ul><li>A brief public notice period</li><li>A five-day public comment period</li></ul>

<p>Before the formation of DCC, the cannabis industry was regulated by:</p>

<ul><li>The California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) &#8211; cultivators</li><li>The California Department of Public Health (CDPH) &#8211; manufacturers</li><li>The Bureau of Cannabis Control (BCC) &#8211; all other license types</li></ul>
