<p>SACRAMENTO – The Bureau of Cannabis Control (Bureau) announced today that California has officially become the newest member of the Cannabis Regulators Association (CANNRA), a non-partisan organization created to facilitate information sharing amongst state regulators, develop more uniformity across state frameworks where practicable, and to assist federal, state, and local jurisdictions that have approved or are weighing the legalization of cannabis.</p>
<p>Formed in November 2020, CANNRA is made of up of the primary regulatory agencies and officials responsible for the oversight of their state’s medicinal and/or adult-use cannabis and also includes the states of Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Utah, Washington, and Washington D.C.</p>
<p>“CANNRA was established to be a forum for regulators across the country to share their experiences and best practices,” said Acting Bureau Chief Tamara Colson, who Governor Gavin Newsom has designated as California’s voting member. “I look forward to this opportunity to further California’s collaboration with regulators from across the country.”</p>
<p>While not an advocacy group, CANNRA seeks to provide policy makers with unbiased information to help them make informed decisions when considering whether or how to legalize and regulate cannabis.</p>
<p>The organization works to ensure all of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>to promote the enactment of the most effective and equitable types of state/territorial cannabis laws and regulations with the goals of preventing distribution of cannabis to minors, preventing the diversion of cannabis to states/territories where it is not legal, preventing criminal enterprises and activities in relation to cannabis businesses, preventing drugged driving and the exacerbation of other adverse public health consequences associated with cannabis use, and protecting consumer, worker, and environmental health;</li>
<li>to devise and promote the use of methods which provide the best enforcement of the particular cannabis laws and regulations in each state/territory;</li>
<li>to work for the adoption of uniform laws, regulations, and best practices insofar as they may be practicable;</li>
<li>to facilitate an exchange of information between regulatory authorities and industry stakeholders;</li>
<li>to provide information to elected officials and policy makers with authority over jurisdictions which may be considering legalizing or adopting new regulatory frameworks for cannabis; and</li>
<li>to strive for harmony in the administration of the cannabis laws and regulations among the several states and territories.</li>
</ul>
