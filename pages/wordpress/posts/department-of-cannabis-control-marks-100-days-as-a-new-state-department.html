<p>CALIFORNIA – Today, California’s Department of Cannabis Control (DCC) marks its first 100 days as a new state department.

<h2>Where we’re going</h2>

<p>DCC is conducting an assessment of all processes and procedures that were in place under the former cannabis programs, with an aim to maintain the best of each former program, further enhance stakeholder engagement and support applicants and licensees. A subset of this work is the aligning the inspection programs for the entire supply chain; DCC is building toward a robust routine inspection program that enhances compliance and accountability for all businesses.</p>

<p>Over the next year, DCC anticipates taking multiple, comprehensive regulatory actions to further simplify and enhance the cannabis regulatory framework. This includes regulations to implement fee waivers for equity applicants and licensees, which will be released within the next 45 days. DCC anticipates ongoing, direct engagement with equity applicants and licensees to better understand their unique needs and challenges.</p>

<p>DCC is deepening partnerships with local and state partners, including to support licensing, compliance, enforcement and equity programs. Through DCC, the state will continue to offer support and technical assistance for local governments, creating pathways for businesses to participate in the licensed, legal marketplace.</p>

<p>Our <a href="https://cannabis.ca.gov/about-us/public-awareness-campaigns/">This is California Cannabis</a> campaign, which promotes the benefits of licensure, will expand during the next six months to include retailers and manufacturers, in addition to cultivators. Additional education and support for businesses to remain compliant post-licensure will be released within the next year.</p>

<p>DCC and the Newsom Administration will make additional appointments over the coming months to fill top leadership and advisory roles. DCC also anticipates ongoing recruitments to fill vacant positions throughout the department. This hiring will support the development of infrastructure necessary to support the department in meeting its mission and fulfilling its mandates.</p>

<p>The Department of Cannabis Control (DCC) licenses and regulates commercial cannabis activity within California. DCC works closely with all stakeholders, including businesses and local jurisdictions, to create a sustainable legal cannabis industry and a safe and equitable marketplace. DCC develops and implements progressive cannabis policies with robust protections for public health, safety and the environment. DCC was <a href="https://cannabis.ca.gov/2021/07/13/governor-newsom-signs-cannabis-trailer-bill-creating-the-department-of-cannabis-control/">formed</a> by merging the three state cannabis programs.</p>
