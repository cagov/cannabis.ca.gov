<p>SACRAMENTO – The State of California’s Employment Training Panel announced that it will now accept and consider cannabis industry applications from licensed businesses. “Licensed cannabis employers who pay the Employment Training Tax can now submit applications for funding of training contracts,” said Employment Training Panel chief deputy director Jill McAloon. “The Panel looks forward to helping licensed cannabis employers expand their businesses by training workers and new hires in industry-required skills.”</p>
<p>The Employment Training Panel is the state’s premier program supporting job creation and retention through training. The Panel reimburses employers for the costs of training existing workers, funds training to unemployed workers to re-enter the workforce, and helps ensure California businesses have the skilled workers they need to remain competitive.</p>
<p>&#8220;An employee&#8217;s access to training is crucial, regardless of the industry,” said Nicole Elliott, Senior Advisor on Cannabis to Governor Gavin Newsom. “The Governor has made it very clear that we want to support legal cannabis businesses, and that includes supporting these businesses’ ability to hire, grow, and promote a skilled workforce. This announcement is just another way the State of California is doing that.”</p>
<p>The Employment Training Panel will process applications for training contracts using the same eligibility requirements currently used for all companies seeking funding. The Panel will also ensure regulatory compliance of valid, current and active cannabis-related licenses from the Bureau of Cannabis Control; the California Department of Food and Agriculture; and the California Department of Public Health’s Manufactured Cannabis Safety Branch.</p>
