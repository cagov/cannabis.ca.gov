<p>SACRAMENTO – The Bureau of Cannabis Control (Bureau) today officially launched its online licensing system and is now accepting applications for commercial cannabis licenses for retailers, distributors, microbusinesses, testing laboratories and cannabis events. The new online licensing system allows applicants to easily apply for a temporary and annual commercial cannabis license, submit payments and track the status of an existing application.</p>
<p>“Today’s launch of our online licensing system is the culmination of many months of hard work by our dedicated team,” Bureau Chief Lori Ajax said. “Now that applications are coming in, we can officially move one step closer to issuing California’s first state licenses for commercial cannabis activity.”</p>
<p>The link to the online licensing system can be accessed here: <a href="http://online.bcc.ca.gov/">http://online.bcc.ca.gov/</a>.</p>
<p>New users will be required to register an account on the Bureau’s online self-service portal prior to applying for a license.</p>
<p>For more information on how to fully utilize the online system, users can check out the site’s e-learning portal, which can be accessed here: <a href="http://www.bcc.ca.gov/clear/e_learning.html">http://www.bcc.ca.gov/clear/e_learning.html</a>.</p>
<p>The Bureau will be reviewing temporary applications and once approved will be issuing temporary licenses with an effective date of January 1, 2018. No temporary license will be effective prior to this date. Temporary licenses will only be issued to applicants with a valid license, permit or authorization from their local jurisdiction.</p>
<p>The Bureau’s emergency regulations are now in effect and the final text can be found at <a href="http://www.bcc.ca.gov/">http://www.bcc.ca.gov/</a> under “Important Announcements.”</p>
