Tax revenue reported by the cannabis industry totaled $93.1 million for 3rd quarter returns received through October 31, 2018, which includes state cultivation, excise and sales taxes. It does not include tax revenue collected by each jurisdiction.</p><p>California&#8217;s cannabis excise tax generated $52.4 million in revenue reported on 3rd quarter returns received through October 31, 2018. The cultivation tax generated $12 million, and the sales tax generated $28.7 million in reported revenue. Retail sales of medicinal cannabis and medicinal cannabis products are exempt from sales and use taxes if the purchaser provides a valid Medical Marijuana Identification card and valid government-issued identification card.</p><p>Previously reported revenue for 2nd quarter returns was revised to $80.2 million, which included $42.3 million in excise tax, $4.7 million in cultivation tax, and $33.2 million in sales tax. Revisions to quarterly data in prior periods are the result of amended and late returns, and other tax return adjustments.</p><p>In November 2016, California voters approved Proposition 64, the <em>Control, Regulate and Tax Adult Use of Marijuana Act</em>. Beginning on January 1, 2018, two new cannabis taxes went into effect: a cultivation tax on all harvested cannabis that enters the commercial market and a 15 percent excise tax upon purchasers of cannabis and cannabis products. In addition, retail sales of cannabis and cannabis products are subject to state and local sales tax.</p><p>To learn more, visit the <a href="https://www.cdtfa.ca.gov/industry/cannabis.htm">Tax Guide for Cannabis Businesses</a> on the CDTFA website.</p><p>Note: This news release may discuss complex tax laws and concepts.
