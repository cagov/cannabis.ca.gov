The new LLC Formation tool was designed and implemented in collaboration with staff from the Secretary of State’s office and the <a href="https://thinksmart.com/">ThinkSmart LLC Platform</a>.</p><p>“ThinkSmart is proud to power the LLC Formations online process,” said Troy Bare, VP of Sales, ThinkSmart LLC. “The core values of our technology focus on streamlining processes for the government through automation with the ultimate goal of making it easier than ever to do business in California.”</p><p>The Secretary of State’s new chatbot Eureka was developed in partnership with Microsoft. It answers frequently asked business entity and trademark questions. Customers can ask a question such as “How do I get a copy of a filed document?” and Eureka will link them to the California Business Search website where they can look up their business record and access documents for free. Eureka responds best to short questions or keywords. The California Secretary of State is the first state-level Department or Agency to use Microsoft’s Artificial Intelligence and bot services to modernize and create efficiencies when providing services to customers.</p><p>The new LLC Formation option and Eureka chatbot assistant are part of Secretary of State Padilla’s Digital Initiative to modernize and digitize the agency’s divisions, including the Business Programs Division.
