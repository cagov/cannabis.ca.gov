<p>CalCannabis Cultivation Licensing, a division of the California Department of Food and Agriculture, has readopted the emergency regulations for commercial medicinal and adult-use cannabis cultivation. This readoption of the regulations features several amendments, which are outlined <a href="http://lists.cdfa.ca.gov/t/75449/107898/1339/3/" aria-label="Regulation amendments">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Effective June 6, 2018</strong>, all applicants seeking temporary licensure must submit the following attachments with every temporary cannabis cultivation license application:</p>
<ul>
<li>A copy of a valid license, permit, or other authorization, issued by a local jurisdiction;</li>
<li><em>New!&nbsp;</em>A proposed cultivation plan;</li>
<li><em>New! </em>Identification of applicable water sources and the applicable supplemental information;</li>
<li><em>New!&nbsp;</em>Evidence of enrollment with the applicable Regional Water Quality Control Board or State Water Resources Control Board for water-quality-protection programs or written verification from the appropriate board that enrollment is not necessary.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please refer to Section 8100 of the emergency regulations for clarification of the temporary license application requirements at the link provided above.</p>
<p><strong>Temporary applications that do not contain all the required information and documentation will be deemed incomplete and will be denied. Any existing temporary licenses or temporary license applications submitted prior to June 6, 2018, are not required to include the additional documentation.</strong></p>
<p>The CalCannabis Licensing System is being updated to reflect these additional requirements. Until that update is complete, applicants may still submit the required documents in one of the following ways:</p>
