<p>About the Cannabis Equity Grants Program for Local Jurisdictions:</p>
<p>The purpose of the Cannabis Equity Grants Program for Local Jurisdictions is to advance economic justice for populations and communities impacted by cannabis prohibition and the War on Drugs (WoD) by providing grants to local jurisdictions (i.e. cities and counties) to support their efforts to promote equity in California and eliminate barriers to enter the newly regulated cannabis industry for equity program applicants and licensees.</p>
