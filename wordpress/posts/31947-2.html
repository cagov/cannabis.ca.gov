<p><span><strong>About the CalCRG program:</strong></span></p>
<p>The CalCRG program will provide grants to community based non-profit organizations and local health departments to support the following activities for communities disproportionately affected by past federal and state drug policies, also known as the War on Drugs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Job placement</li>
<li>Mental health treatment</li>
<li>Substance use disorder treatment</li>
<li>System navigation services</li>
<li>Legal services to address barriers to reentry</li>
<li>Linkages to medical care</li>
</ul>
<p>The effects of the War on Drugs are well documented and visible in communities across the state.  CalCRG staff recognize that while populations living in impacted neighborhoods face significant obstacles to health and wellness, they also possess many assets, collaboratives, and skillful program and service providers who are making positive change.  GO-Biz is excited to work with organizations that are bringing healing and economic empowerment to individuals, families, and communities that have been disproportionately impacted by past federal and state drug policies.</p>
<p>Since the summer of 2018, GO-Biz has solicited input and feedback from stakeholders and interested parties.  Thank you to everyone who attended a webinar, public workshop, or previously submitted a comment letter.  CalCRG staff considered all suggestions and incorporated in the Draft Grant Solicitation much of the input and feedback received.  Again, thank you for your time and we look forward to your feedback on the Draft Grant Solicitation.</p>
