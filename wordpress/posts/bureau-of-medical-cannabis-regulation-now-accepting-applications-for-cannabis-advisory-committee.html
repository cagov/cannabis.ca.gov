<p>The Bureau of Medical Cannabis Regulation (BMCR) today announced that it is now accepting applications for the Cannabis Advisory Committee to advise the bureau on matters relating to both medical and adult recreational use of cannabis.</p>
<p>The committee will advise BMCR and the other licensing authorities – the California Department of Food and Agriculture and the California Department of Public Health – on the development of regulations that protect public health and safety while ensuring a regulated market that helps reduce the illicit market for cannabis. In addition, starting January 1, 2019, the committee will also publish an annual public report describing its activities the previous year, including any recommendations it makes to the state licensing authorities.</p>
<p>Committee members are selected by and serve at the pleasure of the Director of the Department of Consumer Affairs. The committee will consist of representatives from diverse backgrounds, including the cannabis industry, labor, state and local agencies, public health experts, representatives from the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control with expertise in regulating intoxicating substances for adult use, individuals with expertise in the medicinal properties of cannabis and representatives from communities disproportionately affected by past federal and state drug policy, among others.</p>
<p>Members will not be paid but will be reimbursed for any necessary travel for approved advisory committee meetings.</p>
<p>Individuals interested in serving on the committee can access the application online by clicking <a href="https://bcc.ca.gov/about_us/documents/commitee_application.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<p><em>In 2015, the Legislature passed and the Governor signed into law three bills (Assembly Bills 243 and 266, and Senate Bill 643) that create a licensing and regulatory framework for medical cannabis through the Medical Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act. It is anticipated that the regulations will be developed by January 1, 2018. On November 8, 2016, the Control, Regulate, and Tax Adult Use of Marijuana Act (AUMA) was passed by voters as Proposition 64. AUMA legalizes the adult use of cannabis by persons 21 years of age and older.&nbsp;</em></p>
