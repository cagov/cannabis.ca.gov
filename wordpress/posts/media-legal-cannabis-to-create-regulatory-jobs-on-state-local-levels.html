<p>HANFORD, Calif. (KFSN) &#8212; Three state organizations are now in charge of regulating marijuana in California. They will begin licensing businesses in January.</p>
<p>The Bureau of Cannabis Control is taking the lead, and between now and the end of the year, it plans to hire another 80 employees. A spokesperson says part of their work will include incapacitating the black market for marijuana.</p>
<p>&#8220;In order to do that we need people who are going to help regulate the industry, who are going to go to those folks who aren&#8217;t coming into regulation and are resistant, and who are maybe still operating under the old way of doing things where there were no rules and regulations to follow,&#8221; said Bureau of Cannabis Control Spokesman Alex Traverso. &#8220;And (they&#8217;ll) try to get them into compliance or out of business.&#8221;</p>
<p>From staff services manager to environmental scientist, the bureau has jobs posted on the state&#8217;s website right now, under the Department of Consumer Affairs.</p>
<p>CalCannabis, part of the Department of Food and Agriculture, is also advertising jobs on their social media pages. They&#8217;ll be in charge of issuing licenses to marijuana cultivation facilities, which some Valley cities are considering to allow&#8211; local governments will need to hire as well.</p>
<p>Hanford City Manager Darrel Pyle says they&#8217;ll need more employees to process permits, inspect buildings, as well as two more police officers to help with compliance.</p>
<p>Coalinga officials say they&#8217;ve added a police officer and two clerks since allowing cannabis cultivation. They may add more city jobs to keep up with demand.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, state officials say as their regulations roll out, the roles of their employees may overlap with those who work at the local level.</p>
<p>&#8220;Local governments are our partners,&#8221; Traverso said. &#8220;We&#8217;re going to need to sort of work together as we kind of get through some initial growing pains.&#8221;</p>
<p>Traverso says the bureau jobs will be based in Sacramento, but there may eventually be district offices in different parts of the state.</p>
