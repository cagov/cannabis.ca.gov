<p>The California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW), the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) and the State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) are hosting a series of cannabis licensing workshops this January and February.</p>
<p>These free cannabis permitting workshops are designed to help new and existing cultivators navigate the state’s permitting process. CDFA’s CalCannabis Cultivation Licensing Division will provide an overview of the state’s cannabis cultivation licensing program and review the requirements for a cannabis farming license. CDFW will cover Lake and Streambed Alteration agreements and how to limit environmental impacts. The State Water Board will review its cannabis policy, the permitting process and other important information.</p>
<p>The State of California requires commercial cannabis cultivators to obtain the necessary state licenses and local permits, as well as implement best management practices to reduce environmental impacts. Participants will be able to ask specific project questions, obtain permitting materials and meet with state agency staff.</p>
