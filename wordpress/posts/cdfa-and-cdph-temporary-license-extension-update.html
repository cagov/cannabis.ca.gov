<p>The California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) and the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) are in the process of sending notifications to holders of temporary cannabis licenses that are due to expire in early May 2018.  The notifications advise the license holders that their temporary license may be extended for additional 90-day periods if a completed annual cannabis license application is submitted prior to the temporary license’s expiration date, and includes all required components of the application, with the exception of the Live Scan form.  At this time, the ‘Request for Live Scan’ form needed to complete fingerprinting is unavailable.  Annual license applicants will be notified when they are able to complete the form and finalize their owner submissions so the application can be fully processed by the appropriate licensing authority.</p>
