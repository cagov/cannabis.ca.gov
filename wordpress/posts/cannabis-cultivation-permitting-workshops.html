<p>The State Water Resources Control Board (State Water Board) and the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) will host four workshops throughout Northern California focusing on permit requirements and processing. State Water Board and CDFW staff will be onsite to answer your project-specific questions. They will also have computers onsite to help setup your online account and apply for your water quality permits and water rights.</p>
<p>State Water Board and CDFW staff will provide a brief presentation of their cannabis programs including: (1) Cannabis Policy, which establishes the requirements for the Cannabis Cultivation Regulatory Program; (2) Cannabis General Order (water quality permit); (3) Cannabis Small Irrigation Use Registration, which is a streamlined option to obtain a water right to divert and store surface water for commercial cannabis crops; and (4) CDFW’s Lake and Streambed Alteration Agreement for Cannabis.</p>
<p><strong>The primary focus will be answering questions and providing technical assistance with State Water Board and CDFW permit applications.</strong> Registration is not required for these events. <a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2018/08/SWRCB_CDFW-flyer-Aug-2018-.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Please see this flier for details.</a></p>
