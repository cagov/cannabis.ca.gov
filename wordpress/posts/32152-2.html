<p>SACRAMENTO – The Bureau of Cannabis Control (Bureau) today announced that KP Public Affairs of Sacramento was awarded a contract to develop a two-year statewide public awareness and education campaign related to the licensure of commercial cannabis businesses in California.</p>
<p>The Bureau initially issued a Request for Proposals in November 2018 and then proceeded to conduct a thorough review process of all the submitted proposals prior to announcing today’s award.</p>
<p>The upcoming campaign will focus on informing the cannabis industry and the public about the benefits of licensing, how to identify licensed businesses, and why for consumers it’s important to purchase products from the legal market.</p>
