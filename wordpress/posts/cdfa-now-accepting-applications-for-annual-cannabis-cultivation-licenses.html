<p><strong><span>SACRAMENTO&nbsp;</span></strong><span>– <span>The California Department of Food and Agriculture&#8217;s CalCannabis program has begun accepting applications for annual commercial licenses for cultivators, nurseries, and processors.</span></span></p>
<p><span>“After many months of preparation, California’s licensing system for cannabis cultivators is open,” said CDFA’s CalCannabis Director Richard Parrott. “The system allows applicants to begin the registration process now, even if they do not yet have all of their documentation ready.”</span></p>
<p><span>During this initial application period, the program is also accepting applications for temporary licenses that will allow firms to operate while the annual license applications are being processed. Temporary licenses issued by CDFA will be good for 120 days, with the possibility of extensions, if warranted.</span></p>
