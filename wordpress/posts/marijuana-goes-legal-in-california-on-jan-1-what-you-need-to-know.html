<p>Move over, 4/20. California has a new pot holiday: Jan.&nbsp;1, 2018.</p>
<p>It’s a date that dispensaries and&nbsp;marijuana consumers&nbsp;have had in their sights ever since Proposition 64 designated it as the official opening of the adult-use market in California.</p>
<p>After a year of anticipation, the big switch is a month away. Even state regulators are pumped.</p>
<p>“I know this sounds crazy, but we’re looking forward to Jan. 1,&#8221; said Lori Ajax, who heads the state&#8217;s&nbsp;Bureau of Cannabis Control, the agency that will license dispensaries and some other cannabis businesses.</p>
<p>“This is&nbsp;what we’ve been waiting for, what we’ve been training for,&#8221; she said.&nbsp;&#8220;It’s time.”</p>
<p>Whether you’re a long time toker – or someone gearing up to buy your first gram – here are&nbsp;a few things&nbsp;to expect in 2018.</p>
<p><span><strong>Background:&nbsp;</strong><a href="http://www.desertsun.com/story/news/politics/2017/08/23/california-hiring-extensively-recreational-marijuana-approaches/594090001/">California is &#8216;hiring extensively&#8217; as recreational marijuana approaches</a></span></p>
<h2>Can I&nbsp;walk&nbsp;into a dispensary on Jan. 1 to buy pot?</h2>
<p>The short answer is yes, so long as you&#8217;re over 21 and the dispensary has a temporary license from the state. And so long as you can find a pot shop near you.</p>
<p>The state of California says it&#8217;s on track to dole out temporary licenses to dispensaries seeking to sell recreational marijuana even before regulations go live on the first of the year.</p>
<p>Ajax expects the&nbsp;Bureau of Cannabis Control&#8217;s online application system will open in December and that the BCC&nbsp;will begin emailing temporary licenses to retailers before the new year. The licenses&nbsp;will become valid on Jan. 1.</p>
<p>Recreational customers won&#8217;t be able to buy pot at the stroke of midnight.</p>
<p>Instead, customers looking to get their first legal drag of adult-use will have to wait another 6 hours, in keeping with state rules that say retailers can only sell or deliver cannabis between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m.</p>

<h2>Where can I buy pot?</h2>
<p>Depending on where you live, the nearest dispensary might not be near at all.</p>
<p>“There&#8217;s&nbsp;only a handful of cities that are embracing it,&#8221; said Jason Elsasser, a marijuana industry advocate in Desert Hot Springs, a city that has earned the nickname &#8220;Desert Pot Springs&#8221; for its hearty acceptance of marijuana businesses.&nbsp;Elsasser is starting&nbsp;a pot-friendly spa in the city.</p>

Desert Hot Springs spa trying to make pot tourism experience happen</a></span></p>
<p>Oakland&nbsp;and some of Desert Hot Springs&#8217; neighbors&nbsp;in the Coachella Valley are among relatively few cities that have formed recreational marijuana rules ahead of Jan. 1.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, cities have put off the question.&nbsp;Few places in&nbsp;<a href="http://www.sacbee.com/news/state/california/california-weed/article183986026.html">the Sacramento area</a>, for example, are considering opening up&nbsp;adult-use cannabis sales. As of November, San Jose was<a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/2017/11/13/san-jose-considers-lifting-ban-on-recreational-weed-allowing-current-shops-to-sell-and-deliver-pot/">&nbsp;still weighing</a>&nbsp;whether to lift its ban on recreational pot.</p>
<p><span><strong>More:&nbsp;</strong><a href="http://www.desertsun.com/story/news/2017/11/14/shasta-county-makes-official-bans-pot-sales/860831001/">Shasta County makes it official, bans pot sales</a></span></p>
<p>Some parts of the state have doubled down on their opposition to marijuana.</p>
<p>Counties that have come out against pot include Kern County, which rejected Prop 64 with a decisive 53.7 percent of the vote and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/california/articles/2017-10-26/kern-county-bans-marijuana-sales">banned the sale</a>&nbsp;of marijuana in October.&nbsp; Shasta County followed suit,&nbsp;voting against commercial pot in unincorporated areas in November.</p>
<h3>Where can I smoke?</h3>
<p>Across the state, a good rule of thumb is that Californians can&#8217;t smoke pot anywhere they can&#8217;t smoke a cigarette.</p>
<p>That means you can&#8217;t smoke in indoor workplaces, including bars. As for residences, renters should&nbsp;<a href="http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/business/real-estate/sd-fi-prop64-landlords-20161116-story.html">check with their&nbsp;landlords</a>&nbsp;to see if they can smoke at home.</p>
<p>Pot users also can&#8217;t smoke in cars. Using the drug in a moving vehicle or having&nbsp;an open bag in the car are both illegal.</p>
<p>Prop 64 does open the door for local governments to permit marijuana consumption at&nbsp;retailers and companies with a microbusiness license,&nbsp;which combines a small cultivation site, distribution&nbsp;and retail. In that case, the business has to restrict the premises to people 21 and older, can&#8217;t allow&nbsp;alcohol or tobacco use on site and must make sure no one can see people consuming marijuana from outside.</p>
<h2>Will all medicinal dispensaries go recreational?</h2>
<p>No.</p>
<p>For one thing, not every dispensary open&nbsp;today will be granted a temporary or annual license to sell recreational pot, in part because some dispensaries operate without the blessing of their local government. To get a temporary license, retailers have to show the BCC that they have permission to operate from their home city.</p>
<p>“The main thing is, they have to have that local approval,” Ajax said.</p>
<p>Once dispensaries have the proper paperwork, usually a permit of some kind, the BCC can go back to the city to check that it&#8217;s valid.</p>
<p>Second, dispensaries already selling medicinal marijuana can choose whether they want a medicinal license, an adult-use license or both,&nbsp;provided the shop labels its merchandise &#8220;A&#8221; for adult or &#8220;M&#8221; for medicinal and keeps separate transaction records.</p>
<h2>Can I try before I buy?</h2>
<p>Yes and no.</p>
<p>Like a customer sampling ice cream flavors with a wooden tasting spoon, patients at a dispensary today might be accustomed to smelling the marijuana flower before buying it. Then, budtenders weigh the product&nbsp;and serve it over the counter.</p>
<p>Dispensaries will have to rethink those practices once the adult-use market is fully phased in.</p>
<p>Customers are still free to inspect pot with the supervision of an&nbsp;employee, but dispensaries will have to discard any marijuana product employees remove from its original packaging.&nbsp;Only product in tamper evident, child resistant packaging can sell.</p>
<p>“It’s no longer going to be taking the bud out of a used pickle jar and letting the patient sniff it and get their nastys all over it if they sneeze,” said John Chaisson,&nbsp;the co-owner of Atomic Budz in Cathedral City.</p>
<p>Customers should not expect retailers to give away free samples. With few exceptions, marijuana freebies are prohibited by law.</p>

<h2>Are there quality controls for pot?</h2>
<p>Yes. State law requires new testing procedures.</p>
<p>For example, before a cannabis distributor can ship its stock, a laboratory must&nbsp;test samples&nbsp;for things like mold, pesticide residue and bacteria.&nbsp;Labs will also check for compounds like CBD and THC, two of the cannabinoids&nbsp;found in marijuana. Products must be labeled to show weight as well as THC and CBD content.</p>
<p>Chaisson predicts that the added rigor will&nbsp;filter&nbsp;out cultivators and manufacturers whose products aren’t up to snuff.</p>
<p>“Everything is going to have to be tested by a third party and a lot of people are not going to be able to get through that,” Chaisson said.</p>
<h2>What happens to pot products available before Jan. 1?</h2>
<p>With a temporary license, which lasts 120 days with the option for extensions,&nbsp;retailers will have some leeway to sell off inventory they had in stock before 2018.</p>
<p>That means customers might still be able to buy products that haven&#8217;t been tested or that&nbsp;otherwise appear to violate state law,&nbsp;like pot gummy bears that risk &#8220;appealing to children.&#8221;</p>
<h2>I buy pot regularly. Will I notice any changes at pot shops?</h2>
<p>Besides different products, there will&nbsp;be some subtle changes at California dispensaries.</p>
<p>Some marijuana retailers might need to invest in security cameras and alarm systems to stay compliant with state law,&nbsp;or they might start requiring employees to wear a new ID badge if they don&#8217;t already.</p>
<p>But the upshot is this: For consumers, the transition shouldn&#8217;t be too jarring.</p>
<p>“Things are not really going to change that drastically on Jan. 1 (for consumers),” Elsasser said.&nbsp;“There’s going to&nbsp;be a lot of people turning in their applications to the state of California&#8230; but that’s behind the scenes.”</p>
