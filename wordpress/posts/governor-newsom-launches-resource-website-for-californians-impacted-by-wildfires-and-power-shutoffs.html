<p>SACRAMENTO – Today, Governor Gavin Newsom announced the launch of a new state website with tools and resources for Californians who have been impacted by wildfires and utility-directed power shutoffs.</p>
<p>The website, <strong><em><a href="http://response.ca.gov/">RESPONSE.CA.GOV</a></em></strong>, combines emergency response, recovery and resilience information into a single place for easy access by users. It is a one-stop portal that includes local and state resources, health services, shelters and housing, preparedness information, and more.</p>
<p>“California continues to rise to the challenge of power shutoffs and natural disasters,” said Governor Newsom. “<em>RESPONSE.CA.GOV</em> provides Californians with a unified portal for critical information during this state of emergency. This site will continuously be updated as needed to provide Californians with the resources they need.”</p>
<p><strong><em><a href="http://response.ca.gov/">RESPONSE.CA.GOV</a></em></strong> provides Californians with information and resources for current incidents, transportation impacts, vital health services information, shelter and housing locations, unemployment assistance and other state information. The website also directs users to Public Safety Power Shutoff information and preparedness tips. As incidents continue to evolve, the portal will be updated to reflect the latest information and any additional resources the state may develop.</p>
