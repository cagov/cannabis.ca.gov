<p>SACRAMENTO – The Bureau of Cannabis Control (Bureau) and the Department of Consumer Affairs’ Division of Investigation-Cannabis Enforcement Unit (DOI-CEU) today announced enforcement action on an unlicensed cannabis business operating in Sacramento.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, August 22, 2018, DOI-CEU served a search warrant on an unlicensed cannabis home delivery business, The Cannaisseur Club, located off Power Inn Road in Sacramento.&nbsp;This investigation was conducted at the request of the Bureau and was based upon a complaint the Bureau received.&nbsp;The Sacramento Police Department assisted with the service of the search warrant.</p>
<p>The search warrant resulted in the seizure of cannabis flower, concentrates and edibles. The Cannaisseur Club also charged customers for the local taxes, but failed to remit those taxes to the state.</p>
<p>All commercial cannabis activity in California requires a license from one of the state’s three cannabis licensing authorities. Selling cannabis goods without a state license is a violation of state law. Enforcement of unlicensed commercial cannabis activity may occur at the state and/or the local level.</p>
