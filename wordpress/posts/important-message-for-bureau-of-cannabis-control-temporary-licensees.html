<p><span><strong>Temporary License Extensions:</strong></span></p>
<p>Temporary licenses for retailers, distributors, microbusinesses, testing laboratories and cannabis event organizers that were issued with an effective date of January 1, 2018 will expire on April 30, 2018. Temporary licenses may be extended for 90-day periods if the licensee submits a complete annual license application <span>before</span> the expiration date.</p>
<p>To submit a completed annual license application, you must submit documents as requested for each component of the application. After the Bureau receives your completed application, the Bureau may extend your temporary license. The Bureau will then perform a substantive review of the documents provided as part of the application to determine if all requirements are met. If the Bureau determines that the documentation is insufficient, you will be notified by the Bureau.</p>
<p>No extensions will be granted to temporary licensees who do not submit an annual license application prior to the expiration date on their license. If the temporary license expires, the business will be required to cease operations until an annual license has been issued, as operating a commercial cannabis business without an active state license is a violation of the law.</p>
<p><span><strong>Live Scan Requirement:</strong></span></p>
<p>One of the requirements for the annual license application is that Live Scan fingerprinting be completed for each person who qualifies as an “owner” of the business. The ‘Request for Live Scan’ form will be sent to the applicant via email or mail once the annual application has been submitted to the Bureau. The Live Scan form can be taken to any Live Scan operator to have your fingerprints submitted to Department of Justice. The below link provides a list of locations for Live Scan fingerprinting services available to the public: <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/fingerprints/locations">https://oag.ca.gov/fingerprints/locations.</a></p>
