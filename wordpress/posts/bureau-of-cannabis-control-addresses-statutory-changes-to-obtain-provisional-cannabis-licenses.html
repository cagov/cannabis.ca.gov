<p>SACRAMENTO – With the passage of&nbsp;Assembly Bill 97 and Senate Bill 97, the requirements to obtain a&nbsp;provisional&nbsp;commercial cannabis license in California have changed. An applicant is no longer required to hold or have held a temporary license to obtain a&nbsp;provisional&nbsp;license.</p>
<p>A&nbsp;provisional&nbsp;license may now be issued if an applicant has submitted a completed annual license application to the Bureau, including evidence that compliance with the California Environmental Quality Act (Division 13 (commencing with Section 21000) of the Public Resources Code) and compliance with local ordinances enacted pursuant to Section 26200 are either completed or underway.</p>
<p>Please note that <strong>if you already have a pending annual license application with the Bureau, you do not need to submit a separate provisional license application.</strong> We will be&nbsp;reviewing the application to&nbsp;determine if the applicant may be issued a&nbsp;provisional&nbsp;license and will contact the applicant if additional information is required.</p>
<p>Applicants who wish to obtain a provisional license but have not yet submitted an annual license application may now do so by registering an account on the Bureau’s online self-service portal. The link to the Bureau’s Online Licensing System can be found here: <a href="http://online.bcc.ca.gov/">http://online.bcc.ca.gov/</a>.
