<p>The California Community Reinvestment Grants program was included in The Adult Use of Marijuana Act (Proposition 64), which was approved by California voters on November 8, 2016. In accordance with the proposition, GO-Biz will award grants beginning no later than January 1, 2020, to local health departments and qualified community-based nonprofit organizations to support the following activities for communities disproportionately affected by past federal and state drug policies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Job placement</li>
<li>Mental health treatment</li>
<li>Substance use disorder treatment</li>
<li>System navigation services</li>
<li>Legal services to address barriers to reentry</li>
<li>Linkages to medical care</li>
</ul>
<h2>Funding</h2>
<p>The California Community Reinvestment Grants program is funded by the cannabis excise and cultivation taxes imposed by Revenue and Taxation Code sections 34011 and 34012, respectively. Contingent upon sufficient tax proceeds generated, the funding for the grant program is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>$10 million in fiscal year 2018-19 (July 1, 2018 – June 30, 2019)</li>
<li>$20 million in fiscal year 2019-20 (July 1, 2019 – June 30, 2020)</li>
<li>$30 million in fiscal year 2020-21 (July 1, 2020 – June 30, 2021)</li>
<li>$40 million in fiscal year 2021-22 (July 1, 2021 – June 30, 2022)</li>
<li>$50 million in fiscal year 2022-23 (July 1, 2022 – June 30, 2023) and each year thereafter</li>
</ul>
<p>At least 50 percent of the grant funding will be allocated to qualified community-based nonprofit organizations.</p>
<h2>Implementation</h2>
<p>Over the next several months GO-Biz will be soliciting input and feedback from state departments, including the Labor and Workforce Development Agency and the State Department of Social Services, local health departments, community based non-profit organizations, including job skills, job placement, and legal service providers, and other stakeholders and interested parties.  GO-Biz will be holding community workshops across the state starting in October of 2018 to discuss the grant program and solicit input and feedback. Under this timeline, GO-Biz anticipates soliciting and evaluating grant applications during the spring of 2019 and awarding grants by June 2019.</p>
