<p>SACRAMENTO, CA – The Bureau of Cannabis Control (Bureau) announced today the launch of a statewide public information program, “Get #weedwise”, encouraging consumers to only purchase cannabis from licensed businesses and warning unlicensed businesses to become licensed.</p>
<p>The “Get #weedwise” campaign includes extensive outreach educating consumers about the risks associated with cannabis purchased from unlicensed businesses. The campaign also educates unlicensed businesses about the need to be licensed and the consequences of continuing to operate without a license. Currently, all commercial cannabis businesses in California must be licensed by the state and comply with local rules related to commercial cannabis activity in their jurisdiction.</p>
<p>The Get #weedwise campaign is multilingual and will use a variety of advertising methods. For example, Get #weedwise digital advertising will warn consumers about dangerous, foreign material – including chemicals, mold and fecal matter – that can be found in illegal, untested cannabis. The campaign will also include alerts to illegal businesses informing them that they could face confiscation of cash or cannabis by engaging in unlicensed activity.</p>

<p>“This public education campaign is the first to focus on educating consumers about the differences between cannabis purchased from licensed retailers and that from illegal businesses,” said Lori Ajax, Chief of the Bureau of Cannabis Control. “We believe that this campaign will directly impact consumer safety by clarifying that only cannabis purchased from licensed retailers has met the state’s safety standards, while sending a clear message to unlicensed businesses that they need to get licensed or shut down.”</p>
