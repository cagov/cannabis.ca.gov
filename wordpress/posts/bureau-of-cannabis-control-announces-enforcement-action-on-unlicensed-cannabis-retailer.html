<p>SACRAMENTO – The Bureau of Cannabis Control (Bureau) and the Department of Consumer Affairs’ Division of Investigation-Cannabis Enforcement Unit (DOI-CEU), in coordination with the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD), today announced enforcement action on an unlicensed cannabis retailer operating within the city of Los Angeles.</p>
<p>On Thursday, October 25, 2018, DOI-CEU served a search warrant on an unlicensed cannabis retail location, “One Stop Healers,” located at 14064 Foothill Boulevard, Sylmar. The City of Los Angeles confirmed this location had not applied for a local license. The LAPD assisted with the service of the search warrant.</p>
<p>The search warrant resulted in the seizure of over $2,000,000 of cannabis and cannabis products, including almost 500 pounds of cannabis flower, over 430 gross pounds of concentrates, and over 200 gross pounds of edibles.</p>
<p>Sevada Khanlari, the owner of the retail location, as well as six employees, were arrested on misdemeanor charges of operating a commercial cannabis business without a license to do so. Additional charges may be added once the investigation is completed by DOI-CEU and submitted to the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office.&nbsp;The investigation was conducted at the request of the Bureau and was based upon a complaint the Bureau received.</p>
<p>All commercial cannabis activity in California requires a state-issued license from one of the state’s three cannabis licensing authorities. Selling cannabis goods without a state license is a violation of state law. Enforcement of unlicensed commercial cannabis activity may occur at the state and/or the local level.</p>
