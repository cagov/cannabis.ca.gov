<p>SACRAMENTO – The Bureau of Cannabis Control today issued the following statement from Bureau Chief Lori Ajax regarding Weedmaps’ announcement that it would no longer advertise illegal cannabis businesses:</p>
<p>“Yesterday’s announcement by Weedmaps is a step forward for the legal California cannabis industry, which will aid consumers in identifying licensed cannabis businesses when looking to purchase safe cannabis. The Bureau is continuing enforcement activities against businesses not complying with cannabis advertising laws.”</p>
<p>In June, the Bureau officially kicked off its “Get #Weedwise” campaign to encourage consumers to only shop at licensed retailers.

<p>All commercial cannabis activity in California requires a state-issued license from one of the state’s three cannabis licensing authorities. Selling cannabis goods without a state license is a violation of state law. To file a complaint against illegal activity, click here –https://bcc.ca.gov/consumers/file_complaint.html</p>
