<p>SACRAMENTO – The Bureau of Cannabis Control released its California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) Proposed Program study to the public today.</p>
<p>As the lead agency under CEQA, the Bureau has prepared an Initial Study/Proposed Negative Declaration (IS/ND) for the Proposed Program. Based on the findings of the IS/ND, the Bureau has determined that the Proposed Program would not have any significant effects on the environment.</p>
<p>The Bureau is developing regulations pursuant to the Medicinal and Adult-Use Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act (MAUCRSA) to establish a regulatory licensing and enforcement program (Proposed Program) for commercial cannabis distributors, retailers, testing laboratories and microbusinesses.</p>
<p>The overall purpose of the Proposed Program is to establish a regulatory licensing and enforcement program that ensures medicinal and adult-use commercial cannabis activities are performed in a manner that protects the environment, commercial cannabis industry workers, the general public and complies with applicable laws.</p>
<p>The Bureau is making the IS/ND available for public review and will consider public comments regarding the content of the IS/ND.</p>
<p>The Bureau will also host three community workshop meetings to provide the public and regulatory agencies an opportunity to ask questions and submit comments on the IS/ND. These workshops will be available in Long Beach on September 18, Fresno on September 20 and Sacramento on September 21. All meetings will be held from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m.</p>
<p>The formal comment period for the IS/ND for the Proposed Program begins on September 6 and ends at 5 p.m. on October 6.</p>
