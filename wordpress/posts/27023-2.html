<p>The Bureau of Medical Cannabis Regulation (BMCR) today announced that its proposed testing laboratories regulations for medical cannabis have been posted and the 45-day public comment period is now underway.</p>
<p>“These proposed testing laboratories regulations for medical cannabis follow the same process as those regulations announced last week,” BMCR Chief Lori Ajax said. “We continue to move full force ahead to meet our target launch date and I want to encourage people to provide public comment and feedback to help meet our goal.”</p>

<p>Please note these dates, times and locations are different from the hearing dates for the regulations announced last week (<a href="https://bcc.ca.gov/about_us/documents/media_20170428.pdf">Press Release</a>).</p>
<p>Those who wish to provide feedback and are unable to attend one of the four listed sessions above, can get involved in the regulatory process by following the steps outlined <a href="https://bcc.ca.gov/law_regs/17-065_public_comment.pdf" aria-label="Regulatory process steps">here</a>.­</p>
<p>There is currently budget trailer bill language designed to align the Medical Cannabis Safety and Regulation Act with Proposition 64, the Adult Use of Marijuana Act. If that bill passes, the bureau will withdraw these proposed regulations and propose a new set of regulations consistent with changes in the law. However, public comments on the regulations published today are still very important.</p>
<p>Beginning a little more than a year ago, the Bureau kicked off its outreach efforts with nine informational sessions in locations all around the state. Those sessions were followed up last Fall by eight pre-regulatory stakeholder meetings with discussions centering on issues related to general licensing requirements, and specific concepts related to the regulation of medical cannabis dispensaries, distributors and transporters. The feedback from those sessions can be reviewed <a href="https://bcc.ca.gov/meetings/summaries.shtml" aria-label="Feedback from stakeholder meetings">here</a>.</p>
