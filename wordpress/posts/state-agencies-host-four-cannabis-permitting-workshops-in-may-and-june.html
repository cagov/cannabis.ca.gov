<p>The California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW), the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) and the State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) are hosting several cannabis permitting workshops in May and June.</p>
<p>“These free events are designed to help cultivators through the state licensing process,” said James Rosauer, CDFW Cannabis Program Supervisor. “Participants can ask specific project questions and meet staff face to face. There is no better time to get help with a state cultivator license.”</p>
<p>CDFA will provide an overview of the state’s cannabis cultivation licensing program and review the requirements for a cannabis farming license. CDFW will cover Lake and Streambed Alteration agreements and how to limit environmental impacts. SWRCB will review policy and permitting, and other important information. Computers will be available for applicants to apply for water permits. Other agencies may include CAL FIRE, the Department of Pesticide Regulation, the Franchise Tax Board among city and county representatives.</p>
<p>These free workshops are ideal for new and existing cannabis cultivators, and those interested in the topic. Attendees will have time to talk with state agency staff about individual projects after the presentations.</p>
<p>The free workshops are scheduled for the following dates and times:</p>
