<p>While there is no official deadline for submitting a temporary license application to the Bureau of Cannabis Control (Bureau), <span>the Bureau cannot issue temporary licenses after December 31, 2018.</span> The Bureau recommends applicants seeking to obtain a temporary license from the Bureau submit their completed temporary license application <span><strong>as soon as possible.</strong> </span></p>
<p>To issue a temporary license, the Bureau must confirm local authorization to conduct commercial cannabis activity. <span>The local jurisdiction has 10 days to respond to the Bureau once they have been notified.</span></p>
<p>Additionally, the Bureau needs all the required information to issue a temporary license. Our staff will be working weekends and may reach out for any additional documentation we need. Your prompt response will help expedite the processing of your application.</p>
<p>We have received a high volume of applications over the last several weeks and cannot guarantee that all temporary applications received will be processed prior to the end of the year.</p>
<p>The best way to submit your applications is through our on-line system at: <a href="https://aca5.accela.com/bcc/Welcome.aspx">https://aca5.accela.com/bcc/Welcome.aspx</a></p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
