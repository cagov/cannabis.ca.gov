<p>SACRAMENTO &#8212; The Bureau of Cannabis Control (Bureau) will hold a public workshop in Sacramento to receive comments regarding the recent release of its California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) Initial Study and Proposed Negative Declaration (IS/ND) for its regulatory licensing and enforcement program (Proposed Program) for commercial cannabis distributors, retailers, testing laboratories and microbusinesses.</p>
<p>The overall purpose of the Proposed Program is to establish a regulatory licensing and enforcement program that ensures medicinal and adult-use commercial cannabis activities are performed in a manner that protects the environment, commercial cannabis industry workers, the general public and complies with applicable laws.</p>
<p>Based on the findings of the IS/ND, the Bureau has determined that the Proposed Program would not have any significant effects on the environment.</p>
<p>The Bureau recently made the IS/ND available for public review and will consider public comments regarding the content of the IS/ND. The formal comment period for the IS/ND for the Proposed Program began on September 6 and ends at 5 p.m. on October 6.</p>
