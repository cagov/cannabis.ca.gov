<p>The state’s three cannabis licensing authorities developed emergency regulations to implement the mandates of the Medicinal and Adult-Use Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act (MAUCRSA), which was signed into law in June 2017. The Bureau’s initial emergency regulations became effective on December 7, 2017.</p>
<p>The readoption of these emergency regulations was subject to a five-day public comment period, which was held from May 25-30. The public comment period began when the California Office of Administrative Law (OAL) posted the proposed emergency regulations on its website on Friday, May 25.</p>
