<p>SACRAMENTO – The Bureau of Cannabis Control (Bureau) today issued the first group of commercial cannabis temporary licenses for retailers, distributors, microbusinesses and testing laboratories via its online licensing system.</p>
<p>“Last week, we officially launched our online licensing system, and today we’re pleased to issue the first group of temporary licenses to cannabis businesses that fall under the Bureau’s jurisdiction,” Bureau of Cannabis Control Chief Lori Ajax said. “We plan to issue many more before January 1.”</p>

<p>Temporary licenses will only be issued to applicants with a valid license, permit or authorization from their local jurisdictions and become effective on January 1, 2018. A temporary license is good for 120 days, after which a permanent license must be obtained.</p>
