<h5>Release of the draft regulations marks the official start of a 45-day public comment period provided under California law.

<h5>Comments may be submitted in writing during the 45-day open-comment period, or verbally at one of four public hearings that are planned. The hearing schedule is as follows:</h5>
<h5><strong>Tuesday, May 16, 2017, 1pm-3pm</strong><br />
Delhi Center, Ballroom<br />
505 East Central Avenue, Santa Ana, CA</h5>
<h5><strong>Thursday, May 18, 2017, 1pm-3pm</strong><br />
Visalia Convention Center, Sequoia Room<br />
303 East Acequia Avenue, Visalia, CA</h5>
<h5><strong>Thursday, May 25, 2017, 1pm-3pm</strong><br />

200 South School Street, Ukiah, CA</h5>
<h5><strong>Wednesday, June 14, 2017, 1pm-3pm</strong><br />

<h5>The last day for the public to submit written comments apart from public hearings is Wednesday, June 14, 2017, by 5pm (PST).</h5>
<h5>There is currently budget trailer bill language designed to align the Medical Cannabis Safety and Regulation Act with Proposition 64, the Adult Use of Marijuana Act. If that bill passes, these proposed regulations will be withdrawn and a new set of regulations will be proposed that is consistent with changes in the law. However, public comments on the regulations published today are still very important, as many of the provisions in the licensing regulations published today will carry over to new regulations if the trailer bill passes.</h5>
<h5>CalCannabis is preparing to accept applications for state cannabis cultivation licenses beginning January 1, 2018.</h5>
