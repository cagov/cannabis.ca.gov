<h2>Department of Cannabis Control (DCC) regulations</h2>

<p>Regulations are state laws with specific rules for how businesses&nbsp;and others must operate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Current regulations</h3>

<p>The&nbsp;three former cannabis programs had different regulations for cultivation, manufacturing and other license types. DCC is <a href="https://cannabis.ca.gov/about-us/consolidation/" data-type="page" data-id="708">taking steps to consolidate</a> those regulations into one. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The three existing sets of regulations have been moved into one title in the California Code of Regulations. The cannabis regulations are now together in Title 4, Division 19. Sections were also renumbered. This change was made using a rulemaking action called a Section 100. No changes were made to the requirements in regulation.</p>

<h2>Pending rulemaking actions</h2>

<h3>Sharing information with financial institutions</h3>

<p>The three cannabis programs adopted emergency regulations to implement Assembly Bill 1525 in February 2021.

<h2>How regulations are made</h2>

<p>Regulations are made through a process called rulemaking. It gives the public the opportunity to take part in the creation of regulations proposed by California state agencies.</p>

<p>The Office of Administrative Law (OAL) oversees the rulemaking process. OAL makes sure that state agencies follow Californiaâ€™s laws when they adopt new regulations.</p>

<p>There are two types of rulemaking procedures: regular and emergency.</p>

<p>Most regulations are adopted using the regular rulemaking process. Some are adopted using the emergency rulemaking process, which allows rules to go into effect faster. The Department of Cannabis Control (DCC) can use the emergency rulemaking process when making rules for cannabis businesses.</p>

<h3>Regular rulemaking process</h3>

<ol><li>An agency publishes a summary of the proposed regulations in the California Regulatory Notice Register (also called Notice Register). The summary explains what the regulation does, why it is being created and its possible impact.</li><li>The public has 45 days to comment on the proposed regulations.</li><li>The agency publishes a summary of the public comments and the responses in the Notice Register.</li><li>If the agency changes the regulation based on the comments, the public has another 15 days to comment.</li><li>Once the agency is satisfied with the regulations, it publishes an updated summary to the Notice Register.</li><li>The agency has up to one year from the first notice to complete the regulations.</li></ol>

<h3>Emergency rulemaking process</h3>

<p>Emergency regulations are rules that can be put in place immediately while the agency completes the full rulemaking process. The emergency rulemaking process has different requirements, but generally includes:</p>

<ul><li>A brief public notice period</li><li>A five-day public comment period</li></ul>

<h2>Previously-approved rulemaking actions</h2>

<h3>Regulations issued by the former cannabis licensing authorities</h3>

<p>Before the formation of DCC, the cannabis industry was regulated by:</p>

<ul><li>The California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) &#8211; cultivators</li><li>The California Department of Public Health (CDPH) &#8211; manufacturers</li><li>The Bureau of Cannabis Control (BCC) &#8211; all other license types</li></ul>
