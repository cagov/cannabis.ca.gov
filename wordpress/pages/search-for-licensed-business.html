<p>The status tells you if the cannabis license is an active license or not.</p>

<p>Active means the business has an active license. They may do the commercial cannabis activities allowed by their license type. They may operate at the location listed on the license.</p>

<p>The cannabis business cannot do any commercial cannabis activity at the location if they have one of the following statuses:</p>

<ul><li>Expired — The license was not renewed, and it expired.</li><li>Cancelled — The business had a provisional license but did not meet the criteria for an annual license. The license was cancelled.</li><li>Revoked — The license was revoked due to disciplinary action or because the business did not meet local requirements.</li><li>Suspended — The business has a disciplinary action against it. The license is suspended until that action is resolved.</li><li>Surrendered — The business voluntarily gave up their license.</li></ul>
