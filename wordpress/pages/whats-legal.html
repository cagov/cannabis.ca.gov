<h3>Where you can use cannabis</h3>

<p>You can use cannabis on private property, but not in public places like restaurants or bars.</p>

<p>You cannot:</p>

<ul><li>Smoke cannabis where it&#8217;s illegal to smoke tobacco</li><li>Smoke cannabis within 1,000 feet of a school, day care center or youth center while kids are present</li></ul>

<p>Property owners can ban the use of cannabis on privately-owned property. If you rent, read your rental agreement to see if there are any restrictions.</p>

<p>Most hotels do not allow guests to use cannabis in their hotel room. Ask the reception desk about the hotel’s policy to be sure. If you stay in a vacation rental, check with the property owner about the rules for your stay.</p>

<p>Cannabis is still illegal under federal law, which means you also cannot:</p>

<ul><li>Use or possess cannabis on federal lands, like national parks</li><li>Take cannabis across state lines </li></ul>

<h3>Growing cannabis at home</h3>

<p>You can grow up to 6 cannabis plants at home if you’re at least 21 years old. If you turn the cannabis into a product, you cannot use volatile solvents like butane or propane.</p>

<p>Some cities and counties have specific rules for home grows, such as permit requirements or requiring grows to be indoors. Contact your local office to learn the rules in your area.</p>

<h3>Driving with cannabis</h3>

<p>Having an open container of cannabis while driving or riding in a vehicle is illegal. If you have cannabis in a vehicle, it must be in either:</p>

<ul><li>A sealed package or container</li><li>In the trunk of the vehicle</li></ul>

<p>Law enforcement officers can pull you over to conduct a sobriety test if they suspect you are operating a car, boat or other vehicle under the influence of cannabis.</p>
