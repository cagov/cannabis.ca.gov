<p>Cultivators grow all of the cannabis plants that are harvested, sold as flower, and made into products. Their operations look just like other agricultural operations in California. Cannabis cultivation is a multi-step process that includes:</p>

<ul><li>Preparing the land</li><li>Planting seeds or clones</li><li>Irrigating and fertilizing</li><li>Using integrated pest management techniques</li><li>Harvesting plants</li><li>Drying, curing and trimming plants</li></ul>

<h2>Cultivation licenses</h2>

<p>If you want to grow cannabis and sell it in California, you will need a cultivation license. The type of cultivation license you need depends on:</p>

<ul><li>The size of your canopy (the area where you grow mature plants)</li><li>Where you grow your plants (outdoors or indoors)</li><li>Whether you use light deprivation techniques</li></ul>

<p>There are different licenses if you:</p>

<ul><li>Grow seedlings and immature plants only for use by other businesses or sale to consumers (nursery license)</li><li>Dry, cure and trim cannabis after harvest; package cannabis; or make pre-rolls (processor license)</li></ul>

<h2>Use of pesticides</h2>

<p>You can use pesticides on cannabis plants if they meet guidelines set by the Department of Pesticide Regulation (DPR). <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cdpr.ca.gov/docs/cannabis/questions.htm" target="_blank">DPR has resources</a> about:</p>

<ul><li>What pesticides are okay to use</li><li>What pesticides cannot be used</li><li>Pest management practices</li><li>Pesticide safety</li></ul>

<p>Pesticide use is enforced by DPR and county agricultural commissioners. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cdfa.ca.gov/exec/county/countymap/" target="_blank">Contact your county agricultural commissioner</a> if you have questions about pesticides.</p>

<h2>Water permits</h2>

<p>Cannabis cultivators have a responsibility to protect the environment and be responsible stewards of the land. That’s why it’s important to understand how your operations may impact the environment.</p>

<p>All agricultural operations in California are required to get permits and follow rules set by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) and the California Water Boards. These rules help protect water quality and conserve water resources.</p>

<p>CDFW and Water Board rules prevent:</p>

<ul><li>Degradation of water quality</li><li>Excessive water diversions that can injure fish or dry up small streams</li><li>Sediment loading and debris deposits in waterways</li><li>Changes to land that can harm streams and wildlife</li><li>Damage to the environment</li><li>Impacts to threatened or endangered species</li></ul>

<p>Cannabis cultivators must have:</p>

<ul><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://wildlife.ca.gov/Conservation/Cannabis/Permitting" target="_blank">Lake and Streambed Alteration Agreement</a> with CDFW or written confirmation that one is not needed</li><li>Any permits required by the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/cannabis/" target="_blank">Water Board’s Cannabis Policy</a></li></ul>

<p>CDFW has <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://wildlife.ca.gov/Conservation/Cannabis#53534664-resources" target="_blank">resources</a> for managing your cultivation site responsibility, including:</p>

<ul><li>Cannabis Farmer’s Series compliance handbook</li><li>Watershed best management practices for cannabis growers</li></ul>

<h2>Appellations of Origin</h2>

<p>The California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) is developing an <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cdfa.ca.gov/calcannabis/appellations.html" target="_blank">appellations program for cannabis</a>. Appellations are special names reserved for cannabis:</p>

<ul><li>Grown in a certain geographical area</li><li>Grown using certain production standards</li></ul>

<p>Appellations are used for other products, too. For example, the wine industry uses appellations to tell consumers which region the grapes were grown and wine was made.</p>

<p>The cannabis appellations program will:</p>

<ul><li>Help consumers understand where cannabis was grown</li><li>Promote regional products and local businesses</li><li>Prevent misrepresentation of the origin of a product</li></ul>

<p>CDFA is working on regulations for the cannabis appellations program. Once they are adopted, CDFA will begin accepting applications to create an Appellation of Origin.</p>
