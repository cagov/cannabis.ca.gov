<p>Cultivators grow all of the cannabis plants that are harvested, sold as flower, and made into products. Their operations look like other agricultural operations in California. Cannabis cultivation is a multi-step process that includes:</p>

<ul><li>Preparing the soil and growing medium</li><li>Planting seeds or clones</li><li>Irrigating, fertilizing, and managing pests</li><li>Harvesting plants</li><li>Drying, curing and trimming plants</li></ul>

<h2>Cultivation licenses</h2>

<p>If you want to grow cannabis and sell it in California, you will need a <a href="https://cannabis.ca.gov/applicants/license-types/#cultivation-licenses" data-type="page">cultivation license</a>. The type of cultivation license you need depends on:</p>

<ul><li>The size of your canopy (the area where you grow mature plants)</li><li>What kind of lighting is used</li></ul>

<p>There are different licenses if you:</p>

<ul><li>Grow seedlings and immature plants only for use by other businesses or sale to consumers (nursery license)</li><li>Dry, cure and trim cannabis after harvest; package cannabis; or make pre-rolls for other licensees (processor license)</li></ul>

<h2>Use of pesticides</h2>

<p>You can use pesticides on cannabis plants if they meet guidelines set by the Department of Pesticide Regulation (DPR). <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cdpr.ca.gov/docs/cannabis/questions.htm" target="_blank">DPR has resources</a> about:</p>

<ul><li>What pesticides are okay to use</li><li>What pesticides cannot be used</li><li>Pest management practices</li><li>Pesticide safety</li></ul>

<p>Pesticide use is enforced by DPR and county agricultural commissioners. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cdfa.ca.gov/exec/county/countymap/" target="_blank">Contact your county agricultural commissioner</a> if you have questions about pesticides.</p>

<h2>Water permits</h2>

<p>Cannabis cultivators have a responsibility to protect the environment and be responsible stewards of the land. That’s why it’s important to understand how your operations may impact the environment.</p>

<p>All agricultural operations in California are required to get permits and follow rules set by the <a href="https://wildlife.ca.gov/Conservation/Cannabis" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW)</a> and the <a href="https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/cannabis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">California Water Boards</a>. These rules help protect water quality and conserve water resources.</p>

<p>CDFW and Water Board rules prevent:</p>

<ul><li>Degradation of water quality</li><li>Excessive water diversions that can injure or kill fish or dry up small streams</li><li>Sediment and debris being washed into waterways</li><li>Changes to land that can harm streams and wildlife, like erosion or grading</li><li>Damage to native fish and wildlife habitats</li><li>Impacts to threatened or endangered species</li></ul>

<p>Cannabis cultivators must have:</p>

<ul><li>A <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://wildlife.ca.gov/Conservation/Cannabis/Permitting" target="_blank">Lake or Streambed Alteration Agreement</a> with CDFW or written confirmation that one is not needed</li><li>Any permits required by the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/cannabis/" target="_blank">Water Board’s Cannabis Policy</a></li></ul>

<p>CDFW has <a href="https://wildlife.ca.gov/Conservation/Cannabis/Growers-Corner">profiles of cannabis cultivators</a> who use best practices and tips for managing your cultivation site in a wildlife-friendly way.</p>

<h2>Appellations of Origin</h2>

<p>The California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) is developing an <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cdfa.ca.gov/calcannabis/appellations.html" target="_blank">appellations program for cannabis</a>. Appellations are special names reserved for cannabis:</p>

<ul><li>Grown in a certain geographical area</li><li>Grown using certain production standards</li></ul>

<p>Appellations are used for other products, too. For example, the wine industry uses appellations to tell consumers which region the grapes were grown and wine was made.</p>

<p>The cannabis appellations program will:</p>

<ul><li>Help consumers understand where cannabis was grown</li><li>Promote regional products and local businesses</li><li>Prevent misrepresentation of the origin of a product</li></ul>

<p>CDFA is working on regulations for the cannabis appellations program. Once they are adopted, CDFA will begin accepting applications to create an Appellation of Origin.</p>
