<p>California became the first state to allow medicinal cannabis use when voters passed the Compassionate Use Act in 1996. Today, cannabis is legal in California for both medicinal and adult (recreational) use.</p>

<p>The cannabis industry is strictly regulated to make sure:</p>

<ul><li>Businesses operate safely</li><li>Products are contaminant-free and labeled to inform purchasers</li><li>Cannabis is kept away from children</li></ul>

<p>Statutes, regulations and ordinances are all types of laws that work together to set rules for businesses and consumers.</p>

<h2>Department of Cannabis Control&nbsp;(DCC)&nbsp;regulations</h2>

<p>DCC makes regulations for cannabis businesses.&nbsp;These regulations specify:</p>

<ul><li>What you must submit when applying for a license</li><li>Rules for running a cannabis business</li><li>What can and cannot be made into a cannabis product, and what ingredients can and cannot be used</li><li>Packaging requirements to prevent contamination and inform consumers about what’s inside</li><li>The testing that each product must pass before it can be sold</li><li>Enforcement actions that may be taken if a business is not following the rules</li></ul>

<h3>Changes to regulations</h3>

<p>DCC was&nbsp;formed&nbsp;by&nbsp;merging&nbsp;three&nbsp;state cannabis programs.&nbsp;This requires&nbsp;changes&nbsp;to combine&nbsp;the&nbsp;three regulations&nbsp;into one. This will make it easier for businesses, local governments&nbsp;and the public to understand the law.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>What are statutes, regulations and ordinances?</h2>

<ul><li><strong>Statutes</strong> are laws written and passed by the state legislature, and signed into law by the Governor. They apply to the whole state and create a basic structure and rules that everyone must follow.</li><li><strong>Regulations</strong> are rules created by a state agency that interpret the statute and make it more specific. Like statutes, regulations also apply to the whole state. DCC creates regulations that apply to cannabis businesses.</li><li><strong>Ordinances</strong> are rules created by cities and counties to set even more specific rules for the local community. They set the time, place and manner a business can operate or a resident can take certain actions. An ordinance only applies in the city or county that created it. Ordinances can be more specific than regulations or statutes, but they cannot work against them. Check with your city and county to find out if they have passed any ordinances for cannabis.</li></ul>

<h3>Statutes</h3>

<p>The main statute for cannabis businesses&nbsp;in the Business and Professions Code. It is called the <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayexpandedbranch.xhtml?tocCode=BPC&amp;division=10.&amp;title=&amp;part=&amp;chapter=&amp;article=" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Medicinal and Adult Use Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act</a> (MAUCRSA). MAUCRSA sets up a basic framework for licensing, oversight and enforcement.</p>

<p>Cannabis businesses also have to follow the same rules that other businesses in California must follow. For example, there are rules in the statutes about waste disposal, protecting the environment, vehicle registration and paying taxes.</p>

<p>There are also statutes that set rules for people using cannabis in California.
