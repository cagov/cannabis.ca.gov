* All the components currently in `src/components` need to be refined and promoted back to the cagov/design-system repo. Then we can delete these folders from this repository. The npm packages can then be installed to provide the features.
* The build system dependencies should also be externalized so 11ty and all its dependencies can be accessed via npx locally and in github action steps for builds in our pipelines. Planning to port this clean up to a boilerplate site that this repo can refer to for system changes.

# 0.0.1
From [Office of Digital Innovation](https://digital.ca.gov) & [CAWeb publishing](https://caweb.cdt.ca.gov/), July 2021 @DOCS
* Launch initial cannabis.ca.gov (üçÉ) for the [Department of Cannabis Control](https://cannabis.ca.gov) website on [CAWeb](https://caweb.cdt.ca.gov/) publishing [Flywheel](https://getflywheel.com/) instance.
* @DOCS Can we include a reference link here about the project.
* Write a WordPress [plugin](https://github.com/ca-design-system-gutenberg-blocks) to act as a bridge between current monolith sites and a decoupled architecture. (<@DOCS>) 
* ODI uses the built-in WordPress REST API to develop fast loading, light, performant, accessible site. This site is similar in structure to how ODI built the [covid19](https://covid19.ca.gov) (created by the team who developed and maintained this site from March 2020 until the present). 
* This leveraged the work of the Alpha team @DOCS:@abquirarte-(do you have a link?)
